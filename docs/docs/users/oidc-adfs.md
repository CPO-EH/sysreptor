You should now have the following values:

* Client ID
* Client secret

## Cloud Setup

You are lucky. Just send the values from the previous steps to us and we'll take care :smiling_face_with_3_hearts:


## Self-Hosted Setup
:octicons-server-24: Self-Hosted

Create your OIDC configuration for SysReptor...

```json
{
    "adfs": {
        "label": "ADFS",
        "client_id": "<your client_id>",
        "client_secret": "<your_client_secret>",
        "server_metadata_url": "https://adfs.your.domain/adfs/.well-known/openid-configuration",
        "client_kwargs": {
            "scope": "openid profile email",
            "code_challenge_method": "S256"
        },
        "reauth_supported": false
    }
}

```

```env
OIDC_AUTHLIB_OAUTH_CLIENTS='{"adfs": {"label": "ADFS",...}}'
```
The OIDC client needs to be able to establish a network connection to Microsoft ADFS.
Make sure to not block outgoing traffic.

Restart the docker container by going to `sysreptor/deploy` and:

```shell
docker compose up -d
```
