# User Permissions
<span style="color:red;">:octicons-heart-fill-24: Pro only</span>

## Users without dedicated Permissions
Users without dedicated permissions have access to the frontend as regular pentesters. 
They have only read-write access to pentesting reports they are assigned to.  
They cannot read other pentesting reports.

## Superuser
Superusers have the highest privileges available.
They have all permissions without explicitly assigning them. They can access all projects, even if they are not members.

**Note:** The permissions of superusers are restricted after login. Superusers must elevate their privileges via the "Enable Superuser Permissions" button in the main menu (Pro only). This requires the user to reauthenticate with his password and (if enabled) his second factor.

## User Manager
User Managers can create and update other users, assign permissions and reset passwords (except superusers).

Users without this permission can only update their own user information (e.g. name, email, phone number), change their own password, but are not allowed to modify their permissions.

## Project Admin
Project Admins can access and manage all projects, even if they are not members. Users without this permission can only access projects they are members of.

## Designer
Designers can create and edit report designs. Users without this permission can create and edit private designs that cannot be used by other users. They have read access to non-private designs.

## Template Editor
Template Editors are allowed to create and edit finding templates.
Users without this permission have only read access to templates.

## Guest
Guest users permissions can be restricted via global configuration settings by the system operator.
When all guest permissions are enabled, guest users are equivalent to regular users.

* create projects (default: yes)
* import projects (default: no)
* edit projects (default: yes) - read-write access to projects they are assigned to
* update project settings (default: yes) - update project settings like name, design, members, does not affect project content like findings, sections, notes
* delete projects (default: yes)
* see all users (default: no) - see all users on the SysReptor instance or only users working in the same projects as guest users

System is a special privilege that allows users to create backups via API. System users cannot be used in projects, templates and designs. 
This privilege can only be set via the Django interface:

1. Log in with superuser permissions
2. Elevate your privileges using the "Enable Superuser Permissions" button
3. Access https://sysreptor.example.com/admin/users/pentestuser/
4. Choose the user
5. Tick "Is system user"
6. Save

The `system` permission should only be used for backups.
