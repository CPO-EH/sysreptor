   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION

   1. Definitions.

      "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
      and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.

      "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
      the copyright owner that is granting the License.

      "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
      other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
      control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
      "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
      direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
      otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
      outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

      "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
      exercising permissions granted by this License.

      "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
      source, and configuration files.

      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.

      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.

[![Run npm tests](https://github.com/cloudflare/kv-asset-handler/actions/workflows/test.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/cloudflare/kv-asset-handler/actions/workflows/test.yml) &nbsp;
[![Lint Markdown](https://github.com/cloudflare/kv-asset-handler/actions/workflows/lint.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/cloudflare/kv-asset-handler/actions/workflows/lint.yml) &nbsp;

`kv-asset-handler` is an open-source library for managing the retrieval of static assets from [Workers KV](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/kv) inside of a [Cloudflare Workers](https://workers.dev) function. `kv-asset-handler` is designed for use with [Workers Sites](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/platform/sites), a feature included in [Wrangler](https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler), our command-line tool for deploying Workers projects.

`kv-asset-handler` runs as part of a Cloudflare Workers function, so it allows you to customize _how_ and _when_ your static assets are loaded, as well as customize how those assets behave before they're sent to the client.

Most users and sites will not need these customizations, and just want to serve their statically built applications. For that simple use-case, you can check out [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com), our batteries-included approach to deploying static sites on Cloudflare's edge network. Workers Sites was designed as a precursor to Cloudflare Pages, so check out Pages if you just want to deploy your static site without any special customizations!

For users who _do_ want to customize their assets, and want to build complex experiences on top of their static assets, `kv-asset-handler` (and the default [Workers Sites template](https://github.com/cloudflare/worker-sites-template), which is provided for use with Wrangler + Workers Sites) allows you to customize caching behavior, headers, and anything else about how your Workers function loads the static assets for your site stored in Workers KV.

The Cloudflare Workers Discord server is an active place where Workers users get help, share feedback, and collaborate on making our platform better. The `#workers` channel in particular is a great place to chat about `kv-asset-handler`, and building cool experiences for your users using these tools! If you have questions, want to share what you're working on, or give feedback, [join us in Discord and say hello](https://discord.cloudflare.com)!

## Installation

Add this package to your `package.json` by running this in the root of your
project's directory:

```
npm i @cloudflare/kv-asset-handler
```

## Usage

This package was designed to work with [Worker Sites](https://workers.cloudflare.com/sites).

## `getAssetFromKV`

getAssetFromKV(Evt) => Promise<Response>

`getAssetFromKV` is an async function that takes an `Evt` object (containing a `Request` and a [`waitUntil`](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/fetch-event#waituntil)) and returns a `Response` object if the request matches an asset in KV, otherwise it will throw a `KVError`.

#### Example

This example checks for the existence of a value in KV, and returns it if it's there, and returns a 404 if it is not. It also serves index.html from `/`.

### Return

`getAssetFromKV` returns a `Promise<Response>` with `Response` being the body of the asset requested.

Known errors to be thrown are:

- MethodNotAllowedError
- NotFoundError
- InternalError

#### ES Modules

```js
import manifestJSON from "__STATIC_CONTENT_MANIFEST";
import {
	getAssetFromKV,
	MethodNotAllowedError,
	NotFoundError,
} from "@cloudflare/kv-asset-handler";

const assetManifest = JSON.parse(manifestJSON);

export default {
	async fetch(request, env, ctx) {
		if (request.url.includes("/docs")) {
			try {
				return await getAssetFromKV(
					{
						request,
						waitUntil(promise) {
							return ctx.waitUntil(promise);
						},
					},
					{
						ASSET_NAMESPACE: env.__STATIC_CONTENT,
						ASSET_MANIFEST: assetManifest,
					}
				);
			} catch (e) {
				if (e instanceof NotFoundError) {
					// ...
				} else if (e instanceof MethodNotAllowedError) {
					// ...
				} else {
					return new Response("An unexpected error occurred", { status: 500 });
				}
			}
		} else return fetch(request);
	},
};
```

#### Service Worker

```js
import {
	getAssetFromKV,
	MethodNotAllowedError,
	NotFoundError,
} from "@cloudflare/kv-asset-handler";

addEventListener("fetch", (event) => {
	event.respondWith(handleEvent(event));
});

async function handleEvent(event) {
	if (event.request.url.includes("/docs")) {
		try {
			return await getAssetFromKV(event);
		} catch (e) {
			if (e instanceof NotFoundError) {
				// ...
			} else if (e instanceof MethodNotAllowedError) {
				// ...
			} else {
				return new Response("An unexpected error occurred", { status: 500 });
			}
		}
	} else return fetch(event.request);
}
```

### Optional Arguments

You can customize the behavior of `getAssetFromKV` by passing the following properties as an object into the second argument.

```
getAssetFromKV(event, { mapRequestToAsset: ... })
```

#### `mapRequestToAsset`

mapRequestToAsset(Request) => Request

Maps the incoming request to the value that will be looked up in Cloudflare's KV

By default, mapRequestToAsset is set to the exported function [`mapRequestToAsset`](#maprequesttoasset-1). This works for most static site generators, but you can customize this behavior by passing your own function as `mapRequestToAsset`. The function should take a `Request` object as its only argument, and return a new `Request` object with an updated path to be looked up in the asset manifest/KV.

For SPA mapping pass in the [`serveSinglePageApp`](#servesinglepageapp) function

#### Example

Strip `/docs` from any incoming request before looking up an asset in Cloudflare's KV.

```js
import { getAssetFromKV, mapRequestToAsset } from '@cloudflare/kv-asset-handler'
...
const customKeyModifier = request => {
  let url = request.url
  //custom key mapping optional
  url = url.replace('/docs', '').replace(/^\/+/, '')
  return mapRequestToAsset(new Request(url, request))
}
let asset = await getAssetFromKV(event, { mapRequestToAsset: customKeyModifier })
```

#### `cacheControl`

type: object

`cacheControl` allows you to configure options for both the Cloudflare Cache accessed by your Worker, and the browser cache headers sent along with your Workers' responses. The default values are as follows:

```javascript
let cacheControl = {
	browserTTL: null, // do not set cache control ttl on responses
	edgeTTL: 2 * 60 * 60 * 24, // 2 days
	bypassCache: false, // do not bypass Cloudflare's cache
};
```

##### `browserTTL`

type: number | null
nullable: true

Sets the `Cache-Control: max-age` header on the response returned from the Worker. By default set to `null` which will not add the header at all.

##### `edgeTTL`

type: number | null
nullable: true

Sets the `Cache-Control: max-age` header on the response used as the edge cache key. By default set to 2 days (`2 * 60 * 60 * 24`). When null will not cache on the edge at all.

##### `bypassCache`

type: boolean

Determines whether to cache requests on Cloudflare's edge cache. By default set to `false` (recommended for production builds). Useful for development when you need to eliminate the cache's effect on testing.

#### `ASSET_NAMESPACE` (required for ES Modules)

type: KV Namespace Binding

The binding name to the KV Namespace populated with key/value entries of files for the Worker to serve. By default, Workers Sites uses a [binding to a Workers KV Namespace](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/reference/storage/api/#namespaces) named `__STATIC_CONTENT`.

It is further assumed that this namespace consists of static assets such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, or image files, keyed off of a relative path that roughly matches the assumed URL pathname of the incoming request.

In ES Modules format, this argument is required, and can be gotten from `env`.

##### ES Module

```js
return getAssetFromKV(
	{
		request,
		waitUntil(promise) {
			return ctx.waitUntil(promise)
		},
	},
	{
		ASSET_NAMESPACE: env.__STATIC_CONTENT,
	},
)
```

##### Service Worker

```
return getAssetFromKV(event, { ASSET_NAMESPACE: MY_NAMESPACE })
```

#### `ASSET_MANIFEST` (required for ES Modules)

type: text blob (JSON formatted) or object

The mapping of requested file path to the key stored on Cloudflare.

Workers Sites with Wrangler bundles up a text blob that maps request paths to content-hashed keys that are generated by Wrangler as a cache-busting measure. If this option/binding is not present, the function will fallback to using the raw pathname to look up your asset in KV. If, for whatever reason, you have rolled your own implementation of this, you can include your own by passing a stringified JSON object where the keys are expected paths, and the values are the expected keys in your KV namespace.

In ES Modules format, this argument is required, and can be imported.

##### ES Module

```js
import manifestJSON from '__STATIC_CONTENT_MANIFEST'
let manifest = JSON.parse(manifestJSON)
manifest['index.html'] = 'index.special.html'

return getAssetFromKV(
	{
		request,
		waitUntil(promise) {
			return ctx.waitUntil(promise)
		},
	},
	{
		ASSET_MANIFEST: manifest,
		// ...
	},
)
```

##### Service Worker

```
let assetManifest = { "index.html": "index.special.html" }
return getAssetFromKV(event, { ASSET_MANIFEST: assetManifest })
```

#### `defaultMimeType` (optional)

type: string

This is the mime type that will be used for files with unrecognized or missing extensions. The default value is `'text/plain'`.

If you are serving a static site and would like to use extensionless HTML files instead of index.html files, set this to `'text/html'`.

#### `defaultDocument` (optional)

type: string

This is the default document that will be concatenated for requests ends in `'/'` or without a valid mime type like `'/about'` or `'/about.me'`. The default value is `'index.html'`.

#### `defaultETag` (optional)

type: `'strong' | 'weak'`

This determines the format of the response [ETag header](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/ETag). If the resource is in the cache, the ETag will always be weakened before being returned.
The default value is `'strong'`.

# Helper functions

## `mapRequestToAsset`

mapRequestToAsset(Request) => Request

The default function for mapping incoming requests to keys in Cloudflare's KV.

Takes any path that ends in `/` or evaluates to an HTML file and appends `index.html` or `/index.html` for lookup in your Workers KV namespace.

## `serveSinglePageApp`

serveSinglePageApp(Request) => Request

A custom handler for mapping requests to a single root: `index.html`. The most common use case is single-page applications - frameworks with in-app routing - such as React Router, VueJS, etc. It takes zero arguments.

```js
import { getAssetFromKV, serveSinglePageApp } from '@cloudflare/kv-asset-handler'
...
let asset = await getAssetFromKV(event, { mapRequestToAsset: serveSinglePageApp })
```

# Cache revalidation and etags

All responses served from cache (including those with `cf-cache-status: MISS`) include an `etag` response header that identifies the version of the resource. The `etag` value is identical to the path key used in the `ASSET_MANIFEST`. It is updated each time an asset changes and looks like this: `etag: <filename>.<hash of file contents>.<extension>` (ex. `etag: index.54321.html`).

Resources served with an `etag` allow browsers to use the `if-none-match` request header to make conditional requests for that resource in the future. This has two major benefits:

- When a request's `if-none-match` value matches the `etag` of the resource in Cloudflare cache, Cloudflare will send a `304 Not Modified` response without a body, saving bandwidth.
- Changes to a file on the server are immediately reflected in the browser - even when the cache control directive `max-age` is unexpired.

#### Disable the `etag`

To turn `etags` **off**, you must bypass cache:

```js
/* Turn etags off */
let cacheControl = {
	bypassCache: true,
};
```

#### Syntax and comparison context

`kv-asset-handler` sets and evaluates etags as [strong validators](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Conditional_requests#Strong_validation). To preserve `etag` integrity, the format of the value deviates from the [RFC2616 recommendation to enclose the `etag` with quotation marks](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2616#section-3.11). This is intentional. Cloudflare cache applies the `W/` prefix to all `etags` that use quoted-strings -- a process that converts the `etag` to a "weak validator" when served to a client.

@parcel/watcher-wasm 2.5.1
MIT
# @parcel/watcher

A native C++ Node module for querying and subscribing to filesystem events. Used by [Parcel 2](https://github.com/parcel-bundler/parcel).

## Features

- **Watch** - subscribe to realtime recursive directory change notifications when files or directories are created, updated, or deleted.
- **Query** - performantly query for historical change events in a directory, even when your program is not running.
- **Native** - implemented in C++ for performance and low-level integration with the operating system.
- **Cross platform** - includes backends for macOS, Linux, Windows, FreeBSD, and Watchman.
- **Performant** - events are throttled in C++ so the JavaScript thread is not overwhelmed during large filesystem changes (e.g. `git checkout` or `npm install`).
- **Scalable** - tens of thousands of files can be watched or queried at once with good performance.

## Example

```javascript
const watcher = require('@parcel/watcher');
const path = require('path');

// Subscribe to events
let subscription = await watcher.subscribe(process.cwd(), (err, events) => {
  console.log(events);
});

// later on...
await subscription.unsubscribe();

// Get events since some saved snapshot in the past
let snapshotPath = path.join(process.cwd(), 'snapshot.txt');
let events = await watcher.getEventsSince(process.cwd(), snapshotPath);

// Save a snapshot for later
await watcher.writeSnapshot(process.cwd(), snapshotPath);
```

## Watching

`@parcel/watcher` supports subscribing to realtime notifications of changes in a directory. It works recursively, so changes in sub-directories will also be emitted.

Events are throttled and coalesced for performance during large changes like `git checkout` or `npm install`, and a single notification will be emitted with all of the events at the end.

Only one notification will be emitted per file. For example, if a file was both created and updated since the last event, you'll get only a `create` event. If a file is both created and deleted, you will not be notifed of that file. Renames cause two events: a `delete` for the old name, and a `create` for the new name.

```javascript
let subscription = await watcher.subscribe(process.cwd(), (err, events) => {
  console.log(events);
});
```

Events have two properties:

- `type` - the event type: `create`, `update`, or `delete`.
- `path` - the absolute path to the file or directory.

To unsubscribe from change notifications, call the `unsubscribe` method on the returned subscription object.

```javascript
await subscription.unsubscribe();
```

`@parcel/watcher` has the following watcher backends, listed in priority order:

- [FSEvents](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coreservices/file_system_events) on macOS
- [Watchman](https://facebook.github.io/watchman/) if installed
- [inotify](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/inotify.7.html) on Linux
- [ReadDirectoryChangesW](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa365465%28v%3Dvs.85%29.aspx) on Windows
- [kqueue](https://man.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?kqueue) on FreeBSD, or as an alternative to FSEvents on macOS

You can specify the exact backend you wish to use by passing the `backend` option. If that backend is not available on the current platform, the default backend will be used instead. See below for the list of backend names that can be passed to the options.

## Querying

`@parcel/watcher` also supports querying for historical changes made in a directory, even when your program is not running. This makes it easy to invalidate a cache and re-build only the files that have changed, for example. It can be **significantly** faster than traversing the entire filesystem to determine what files changed, depending on the platform.

In order to query for historical changes, you first need a previous snapshot to compare to. This can be saved to a file with the `writeSnapshot` function, e.g. just before your program exits.

```javascript
await watcher.writeSnapshot(dirPath, snapshotPath);
```

When your program starts up, you can query for changes that have occurred since that snapshot using the `getEventsSince` function.

```javascript
let events = await watcher.getEventsSince(dirPath, snapshotPath);
```

The events returned are exactly the same as the events that would be passed to the `subscribe` callback (see above).

`@parcel/watcher` has the following watcher backends, listed in priority order:

- [FSEvents](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coreservices/file_system_events) on macOS
- [Watchman](https://facebook.github.io/watchman/) if installed
- [fts](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/fts.3.html) (brute force) on Linux and FreeBSD
- [FindFirstFile](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/api/fileapi/nf-fileapi-findfirstfilea) (brute force) on Windows

The FSEvents (macOS) and Watchman backends are significantly more performant than the brute force backends used by default on Linux and Windows, for example returning results in miliseconds instead of seconds for large directory trees. This is because a background daemon monitoring filesystem changes on those platforms allows us to query cached data rather than traversing the filesystem manually (brute force).

macOS has good performance with FSEvents by default. For the best performance on other platforms, install [Watchman](https://facebook.github.io/watchman/) and it will be used by `@parcel/watcher` automatically.

You can specify the exact backend you wish to use by passing the `backend` option. If that backend is not available on the current platform, the default backend will be used instead. See below for the list of backend names that can be passed to the options.

## Options

All of the APIs in `@parcel/watcher` support the following options, which are passed as an object as the last function argument.

- `ignore` - an array of paths or glob patterns to ignore. uses [`is-glob`](https://github.com/micromatch/is-glob) to distinguish paths from globs. glob patterns are parsed with [`micromatch`](https://github.com/micromatch/micromatch) (see [features](https://github.com/micromatch/micromatch#matching-features)).
  - paths can be relative or absolute and can either be files or directories. No events will be emitted about these files or directories or their children.
  - glob patterns match on relative paths from the root that is watched. No events will be emitted for matching paths.
- `backend` - the name of an explicitly chosen backend to use. Allowed options are `"fs-events"`, `"watchman"`, `"inotify"`, `"kqueue"`, `"windows"`, or `"brute-force"` (only for querying). If the specified backend is not available on the current platform, the default backend will be used instead.

## WASM

The `@parcel/watcher-wasm` package can be used in place of `@parcel/watcher` on unsupported platforms. It relies on the Node `fs` module, so in non-Node environments such as browsers, an `fs` polyfill will be needed.

**Note**: the WASM implementation is significantly less efficient than the native implementations because it must crawl the file system to watch each directory individually. Use the native `@parcel/watcher` package wherever possible.

```js
import {subscribe} from '@parcel/watcher-wasm';

// Use the module as documented above.
subscribe(/* ... */);
```

      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You

          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not

          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided

      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

# @polka/url [![npm](https://badgen.now.sh/npm/v/@polka/url)](https://npmjs.org/package/@polka/url) [![licenses](https://licenses.dev/b/npm/%40polka%2Furl)](https://licenses.dev/npm/%40polka%2Furl)

> Super fast, memoized `req.url` parser; _not_ limited to [Polka][polka]!

Parses the `url` from a [`IncomingMessage`](https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#http_class_http_incomingmessage) request. The returned object will always only contain the following keys: `search`, `query`, `pathname`, and `raw`.

> **Note:** This library does not process `protocol`, `hostname`, `port`, etc.<br>This is because the incoming `req.url` value only begins with the path information.

Parsed requests will be mutated with a `_parsedUrl` key, containing the returned output. This is used for future memoization, avoiding the need to fully parse the same `url` value multiple times.

## Install

```
$ npm install --save @polka/url
```

## Usage

```js
const parse = require('@polka/url');

let req = {
  url: '/foo/bar?fizz=buzz'
};
let output = parse(req);
//=> {
//=>   pathname: '/foo/bar',
//=>   raw: '/foo/bar?fizz=buzz',
//=>   search: '?fizz=buzz',
//=>   query: {
//=>     fizz: 'buzz'
//=>   },
//=> }

// Attaches result for future memoization
assert.deepEqual(output, req._parsedUrl); //=> true
```

## API

### url(req)
Returns: `Object` or `undefined`

> **Important:** The `req` must have a `url` key, otherwise `undefined` will be returned.<br>If no input is provided at all, a `TypeError` will be thrown.

#### req
Type: `IncomingMessage` or `{ url: string }`

The incoming HTTP request (`req`) or a plain `Object` with a `url` key.

> **Note:** In Node.js servers, the [`req.url`](https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#http_message_url) begins with a pathname & does not include a `hash`.


## Benchmarks

Check out the [`bench`](/bench) directory for in-depth benchmark results and comparisons.


## Support

Any issues or questions can be sent to the [Polka][polka] repository.<br>However, please specify that your inquiry is about `@polka/url` specifically.

# openapi-core

See https://github.com/Redocly/redocly-cli

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The `openapi-core package` is designed for our internal use; the interfaces that are considered safe to use are documented below.
> Some of the function arguments are not documented below because they are not intended for public use.
> Avoid using any functions or features that are not documented below.
> If your use case is not documented below, please open an issue.

## Basic usage

### Lint from file system

[Lint](https://redocly.com/docs/cli/commands/lint/) a file.

```js
import { lint, loadConfig } from '@redocly/openapi-core';

const pathToApi = 'openapi.yaml';
const config = await loadConfig({ configPath: 'optional/path/to/redocly.yaml' });
const lintResults = await lint({ ref: pathToApi, config });
```

The content of `lintResults` describes any errors or warnings found during linting; an empty array means no problems were found.
For each problem, the rule, severity, feedback message and a location object are provided.
To learn more, [check the `lint` function section](#lint).

### Bundle from file system

[Bundle](https://redocly.com/docs/cli/commands/bundle/) an API description into a single structure.

```js
import { bundle, loadConfig } from '@redocly/openapi-core';

const pathToApi = 'openapi.yaml';
const config = await loadConfig({ configPath: 'optional/path/to/redocly.yaml' });
const bundleResults = await bundle({ ref: pathToApi, config });
```

In `bundleResults`, the `bundle.parsed` field has the bundled API description.
For more information, [check the `bundle` function section](#bundle).

### Lint from memory with config

[Lint](https://redocly.com/docs/cli/commands/lint/) an API description, with configuration defined. This is useful if the API description you're working with isn't a file on disk.

```js
import { lintFromString, createConfig, stringifyYaml } from '@redocly/openapi-core';

const config = await createConfig(
  {
    extends: ['minimal'],
    rules: {
      'operation-description': 'error',
    },
  },
  {
    // optionally provide config path for resolving $refs and proper error locations
    configPath: 'optional/path/to/redocly.yaml',
  }
);
const source = stringifyYaml({ openapi: '3.0.1' /* ... */ }); // you can also use JSON.stringify
const lintResults = await lintFromString({
  source,
  // optionally pass path to the file for resolving $refs and proper error locations
  absoluteRef: 'optional/path/to/openapi.yaml',
  config,
});
```

### Lint from memory with a custom plugin

[Lint](https://redocly.com/docs/cli/commands/lint/) an API description, with configuration including a [custom plugin](https://redocly.com/docs/cli/custom-plugins/) to define a rule.

```js
import { lintFromString, createConfig, stringifyYaml } from '@redocly/openapi-core';

const CustomRule = (ruleOptions) => {
  return {
    Operation() {
      // some rule logic
    },
  };
};

const config = await createConfig({
  extends: ['recommended'],
  plugins: [
    {
      id: 'pluginId',
      rules: {
        oas3: {
          customRule1: CustomRule,
        },
        oas2: {
          customRule1: CustomRule, // if the same rule can handle both oas3 and oas2
        },
      },
      decorators: {
        // ...
      },
    },
  ],
  // enable rule
  rules: {
    'pluginId/customRule1': 'error',
  },
  decorators: {
    // ...
  },
});

const source = stringifyYaml({ openapi: '3.0.1' /* ... */ }); // you can also use JSON.stringify
const lintResults = await lintFromString({
  source,
  // optionally pass path to the file for resolving $refs and proper error locations
  absoluteRef: 'optional/path/to/openapi.yaml',
  config,
});
```

### Bundle from memory

[Bundle](https://redocly.com/docs/cli/commands/bundle/) an API description into a single structure, using default configuration.

```js
import { bundleFromString, createConfig } from '@redocly/openapi-core';

const config = await createConfig({}); // create empty config
const source = stringifyYaml({ openapi: '3.0.1' /* ... */ }); // you can also use JSON.stringify
const bundleResults = await bundleFromString({
  source,
  // optionally pass path to the file for resolving $refs and proper error locations
  absoluteRef: 'optional/path/to/openapi.yaml',
  config,
});
```

## API

### `createConfig`

Creates a config object from a JSON or YAML string or JS object.

  config: string | RawUniversalConfig,
  options?: {
    // optional path to the config file for resolving $refs and proper error locations
    configPath?: string;
  }
): Promise<Config>;
```

### `loadConfig`

Loads a config object from a file system. If `configPath` is not provided,
it tries to find `redocly.yaml` in the current working directory.

```ts
async function loadConfig(options?: {
  // optional path to the config file for resolving $refs and proper error locations
  configPath?: string;
  // allows to add custom `extends` additionally to one from the config file
  customExtends?: string[];

  // config object
  config: Config;
}): Promise<NormalizedProblem[]>;
```

### `lintFromString`

Lint an OpenAPI document from a string.

```ts
async function lintFromString(options: {
  // OpenAPI document string
  source: string;
  // optional path to the OpenAPI document for resolving $refs and proper error locations
  absoluteRef?: string;
  // config object
  config: Config;
}): Promise<NormalizedProblem[]>;
```

### `bundle`

Bundle an OpenAPI document from the file system.

```ts
async function bundle(options: {
  // path to the OpenAPI document root
  ref: string;
  // config object
  config: Config;
  // whether to fully dereference $refs, resulting document won't have any $ref
  // warning: this can produce circular objects
  dereference?: boolean;
  // whether to remove unused components (schemas, parameters, responses, etc)
  removeUnusedComponents?: boolean;
  // whether to keep $ref pointers to the http URLs and resolve only local fs $refs
  keepUrlRefs?: boolean;
}): Promise<{
    bundle: {
      parsed: object; // OpenAPI document object as js object
    };
    problems: NormalizedProblem[]
    fileDependencies
    rootType
    refTypes
    visitorsData

  }>;
```

### `bundleFromString`

Bundle an OpenAPI document from a string.

```ts
async function bundleFromString(options: {
  // OpenAPI document string
  source: string;
  // optional path to the OpenAPI document for resolving $refs and proper error locations
  absoluteRef?: string;
  // config object
  config: Config;
  // whether to fully dereference $refs, resulting document won't have any $ref
  // warning: this can produce circular objects
  dereference?: boolean;
  // whether to remove unused components (schemas, parameters, responses, etc)
  removeUnusedComponents?: boolean;
  // whether to keep $ref pointers to the http URLs and resolve only local fs $refs
  keepUrlRefs?: boolean;
}): Promise<{
    bundle: {
      parsed: object; // OpenAPI document object as js object
    };
    problems: NormalizedProblem[]
    fileDependencies
    rootType
    refTypes
    visitorsData

  }>;
```

### `stringifyYaml`

Helper function to stringify a javascript object to YAML.

```ts
function stringifyYaml(obj: object): string;
```

# @rollup/plugin-inject

🍣 A Rollup plugin which scans modules for global variables and injects `import` statements where necessary.

## Requirements

This plugin requires an [LTS](https://github.com/nodejs/Release) Node version (v14.0.0+) and Rollup v1.20.0+.

## Install

Using npm:

```console
npm install @rollup/plugin-inject --save-dev
```

## Usage

Create a `rollup.config.js` [configuration file](https://www.rollupjs.org/guide/en/#configuration-files) and import the plugin:

```js
import inject from '@rollup/plugin-inject';

export default {
  input: 'src/index.js',
  output: {
    dir: 'output',
    format: 'cjs'
  },
  plugins: [
    inject({
      Promise: ['es6-promise', 'Promise']
    })
  ]
};
```

Then call `rollup` either via the [CLI](https://www.rollupjs.org/guide/en/#command-line-reference) or the [API](https://www.rollupjs.org/guide/en/#javascript-api).

This configuration above will scan all your files for global Promise usage and plugin will add import to desired module (`import { Promise } from 'es6-promise'` in this case).

Examples:

```js
{
  // import { Promise } from 'es6-promise'
  Promise: [ 'es6-promise', 'Promise' ],

  // import { Promise as P } from 'es6-promise'
  P: [ 'es6-promise', 'Promise' ],

  // import $ from 'jquery'
  $: 'jquery',

  // import * as fs from 'fs'
  fs: [ 'fs', '*' ],

  // use a local module instead of a third-party one
  'Object.assign': path.resolve( 'src/helpers/object-assign.js' ),
}
```

Typically, `@rollup/plugin-inject` should be placed in `plugins` _before_ other plugins so that they may apply optimizations, such as dead code removal.

## Options

In addition to the properties and values specified for injecting, users may also specify the options below.

### `exclude`

Type: `String` | `Array[...String]`<br>
Default: `null`

A [picomatch pattern](https://github.com/micromatch/picomatch), or array of patterns, which specifies the files in the build the plugin should _ignore_. By default no files are ignored.

### `include`

Type: `String` | `Array[...String]`<br>
Default: `null`

A [picomatch pattern](https://github.com/micromatch/picomatch), or array of patterns, which specifies the files in the build the plugin should operate on. By default all files are targeted.

@speed-highlight/core 1.2.7
CC0-1.0
Creative Commons Legal Code

CC0 1.0 Universal

    CREATIVE COMMONS CORPORATION IS NOT A LAW FIRM AND DOES NOT PROVIDE
    LEGAL SERVICES. DISTRIBUTION OF THIS DOCUMENT DOES NOT CREATE AN
    ATTORNEY-CLIENT RELATIONSHIP. CREATIVE COMMONS PROVIDES THIS
    INFORMATION ON AN "AS-IS" BASIS. CREATIVE COMMONS MAKES NO WARRANTIES
    REGARDING THE USE OF THIS DOCUMENT OR THE INFORMATION OR WORKS
    PROVIDED HEREUNDER, AND DISCLAIMS LIABILITY FOR DAMAGES RESULTING FROM
    THE USE OF THIS DOCUMENT OR THE INFORMATION OR WORKS PROVIDED
    HEREUNDER.

Statement of Purpose

The laws of most jurisdictions throughout the world automatically confer
exclusive Copyright and Related Rights (defined below) upon the creator
and subsequent owner(s) (each and all, an "owner") of an original work of
authorship and/or a database (each, a "Work").

Certain owners wish to permanently relinquish those rights to a Work for
the purpose of contributing to a commons of creative, cultural and
scientific works ("Commons") that the public can reliably and without fear
of later claims of infringement build upon, modify, incorporate in other
works, reuse and redistribute as freely as possible in any form whatsoever
and for any purposes, including without limitation commercial purposes.
These owners may contribute to the Commons to promote the ideal of a free
culture and the further production of creative, cultural and scientific
works, or to gain reputation or greater distribution for their Work in
part through the use and efforts of others.

For these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any
expectation of additional consideration or compensation, the person
associating CC0 with a Work (the "Affirmer"), to the extent that he or she
is an owner of Copyright and Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily
elects to apply CC0 to the Work and publicly distribute the Work under its
terms, with knowledge of his or her Copyright and Related Rights in the
Work and the meaning and intended legal effect of CC0 on those rights.

1. Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available under CC0 may be
protected by copyright and related or neighboring rights ("Copyright and
Related Rights"). Copyright and Related Rights include, but are not
limited to, the following:

  i. the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display,
     communicate, and translate a Work;
 ii. moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s);
iii. publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person's image or
     likeness depicted in a Work;
 iv. rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work,
     subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(a), below;
  v. rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of data
     in a Work;
 vi. database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC of the
     European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal
     protection of databases, and under any national implementation
     thereof, including any amended or successor version of such
     directive); and
vii. other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the
     world based on applicable law or treaty, and any national
     implementations thereof.

2. Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention
of, applicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently,
irrevocably and unconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all of
Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights and associated claims and causes
of action, whether now known or unknown (including existing as well as
future claims and causes of action), in the Work (i) in all territories
worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration provided by applicable law or
treaty (including future time extensions), (iii) in any current or future
medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever,
including without limitation commercial, advertising or promotional
purposes (the "Waiver"). Affirmer makes the Waiver for the benefit of each
member of the public at large and to the detriment of Affirmer's heirs and
successors, fully intending that such Waiver shall not be subject to
revocation, rescission, cancellation, termination, or any other legal or
equitable action to disrupt the quiet enjoyment of the Work by the public
as contemplated by Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.

3. Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any reason
be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, then the
Waiver shall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into
account Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to the
extent the Waiver is so judged Affirmer hereby grants to each affected
person a royalty-free, non transferable, non sublicensable, non exclusive,
irrevocable and unconditional license to exercise Affirmer's Copyright and
Related Rights in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the
maximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future
time extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number
of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without
limitation commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the
"License"). The License shall be deemed effective as of the date CC0 was
applied by Affirmer to the Work. Should any part of the License for any
reason be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, such
partial invalidity or ineffectiveness shall not invalidate the remainder
of the License, and in such case Affirmer hereby affirms that he or she
will not (i) exercise any of his or her remaining Copyright and Related
Rights in the Work or (ii) assert any associated claims and causes of
action with respect to the Work, in either case contrary to Affirmer's
express Statement of Purpose.

4. Limitations and Disclaimers.

 a. No trademark or patent rights held by Affirmer are waived, abandoned,
    surrendered, licensed or otherwise affected by this document.
 b. Affirmer offers the Work as-is and makes no representations or
    warranties of any kind concerning the Work, express, implied,
    statutory or otherwise, including without limitation warranties of
    title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non
    infringement, or the absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or
    the present or absence of errors, whether or not discoverable, all to
    the greatest extent permissible under applicable law.
 c. Affirmer disclaims responsibility for clearing rights of other persons
    that may apply to the Work or any use thereof, including without
    limitation any person's Copyright and Related Rights in the Work.
    Further, Affirmer disclaims responsibility for obtaining any necessary
    consents, permissions or other rights required for any use of the
    Work.
 d. Affirmer understands and acknowledges that Creative Commons is not a
    party to this document and has no duty or obligation with respect to
    this CC0 or use of the Work.

argparse 2.0.1
Python-2.0
A. HISTORY OF THE SOFTWARE
==========================

Python was created in the early 1990s by Guido van Rossum at Stichting
Mathematisch Centrum (CWI, see http://www.cwi.nl) in the Netherlands
as a successor of a language called ABC.  Guido remains Python's
principal author, although it includes many contributions from others.

In 1995, Guido continued his work on Python at the Corporation for
National Research Initiatives (CNRI, see http://www.cnri.reston.va.us)
in Reston, Virginia where he released several versions of the
software.

In May 2000, Guido and the Python core development team moved to
BeOpen.com to form the BeOpen PythonLabs team.  In October of the same
year, the PythonLabs team moved to Digital Creations, which became
Zope Corporation.  In 2001, the Python Software Foundation (PSF, see
https://www.python.org/psf/) was formed, a non-profit organization
created specifically to own Python-related Intellectual Property.
Zope Corporation was a sponsoring member of the PSF.

All Python releases are Open Source (see http://www.opensource.org for
the Open Source Definition).  Historically, most, but not all, Python
releases have also been GPL-compatible; the table below summarizes
the various releases.

    Release         Derived     Year        Owner       GPL-
                    from                                compatible? (1)

    0.9.0 thru 1.2              1991-1995   CWI         yes
    1.3 thru 1.5.2  1.2         1995-1999   CNRI        yes
    1.6             1.5.2       2000        CNRI        no
    2.0             1.6         2000        BeOpen.com  no
    1.6.1           1.6         2001        CNRI        yes (2)
    2.1             2.0+1.6.1   2001        PSF         no
    2.0.1           2.0+1.6.1   2001        PSF         yes
    2.1.1           2.1+2.0.1   2001        PSF         yes
    2.1.2           2.1.1       2002        PSF         yes
    2.1.3           2.1.2       2002        PSF         yes
    2.2 and above   2.1.1       2001-now    PSF         yes

Footnotes:

(1) GPL-compatible doesn't mean that we're distributing Python under
    the GPL.  All Python licenses, unlike the GPL, let you distribute
    a modified version without making your changes open source.  The
    GPL-compatible licenses make it possible to combine Python with
    other software that is released under the GPL; the others don't.

(2) According to Richard Stallman, 1.6.1 is not GPL-compatible,
    because its license has a choice of law clause.  According to
    CNRI, however, Stallman's lawyer has told CNRI's lawyer that 1.6.1
    is "not incompatible" with the GPL.

Thanks to the many outside volunteers who have worked under Guido's
direction to make these releases possible.

      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
      source, and configuration files.

      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.

      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

boolbase 1.0.0
ISC
#boolbase
This very simple module provides two basic functions, one that always returns true (`trueFunc`) and one that always returns false (`falseFunc`).

###WTF?

By having only a single instance of these functions around, it's possible to do some nice optimizations. Eg. [`CSSselect`](https://github.com/fb55/CSSselect) uses these functions to determine whether a selector won't match any elements. If that's the case, the DOM doesn't even have to be touched.

###And why is this a separate module?

I'm trying to modularize `CSSselect` and most modules depend on these functions. IMHO, having a separate module is the easiest solution to this problem.

Using Creative Commons Public Licenses

Creative Commons public licenses provide a standard set of terms and
conditions that creators and other rights holders may use to share
original works of authorship and other material subject to copyright
and certain other rights specified in the public license below. The
following considerations are for informational purposes only, are not
exhaustive, and do not form part of our licenses.

     Considerations for licensors: Our public licenses are
     intended for use by those authorized to give the public
     permission to use material in ways otherwise restricted by
     copyright and certain other rights. Our licenses are
     irrevocable. Licensors should read and understand the terms
     and conditions of the license they choose before applying it.
     Licensors should also secure all rights necessary before
     applying our licenses so that the public can reuse the
     material as expected. Licensors should clearly mark any
     material not subject to the license. This includes other CC-
     licensed material, or material used under an exception or
     limitation to copyright. More considerations for licensors:
	wiki.creativecommons.org/Considerations_for_licensors

     Considerations for the public: By using one of our public
     licenses, a licensor grants the public permission to use the
     licensed material under specified terms and conditions. If
     the licensor's permission is not necessary for any reason--for
     example, because of any applicable exception or limitation to
     copyright--then that use is not regulated by the license. Our
     licenses grant only permissions under copyright and certain
     other rights that a licensor has authority to grant. Use of
     the licensed material may still be restricted for other
     reasons, including because others have copyright or other
     rights in the material. A licensor may make special requests,
     such as asking that all changes be marked or described.
     Although not required by our licenses, you are encouraged to
     respect those requests where reasonable. More_considerations

=======================================================================

Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International Public License

By exercising the Licensed Rights (defined below), You accept and agree
to be bound by the terms and conditions of this Creative Commons
Attribution 4.0 International Public License ("Public License"). To the
extent this Public License may be interpreted as a contract, You are
granted the Licensed Rights in consideration of Your acceptance of
these terms and conditions, and the Licensor grants You such rights in
consideration of benefits the Licensor receives from making the
Licensed Material available under these terms and conditions.


Section 1 -- Definitions.

  a. Adapted Material means material subject to Copyright and Similar
     Rights that is derived from or based upon the Licensed Material
     and in which the Licensed Material is translated, altered,
     arranged, transformed, or otherwise modified in a manner requiring
     permission under the Copyright and Similar Rights held by the
     Licensor. For purposes of this Public License, where the Licensed
     Material is a musical work, performance, or sound recording,
     Adapted Material is always produced where the Licensed Material is
     synched in timed relation with a moving image.

  b. Adapter's License means the license You apply to Your Copyright
     and Similar Rights in Your contributions to Adapted Material in
     accordance with the terms and conditions of this Public License.

  c. Copyright and Similar Rights means copyright and/or similar rights
     closely related to copyright including, without limitation,
     performance, broadcast, sound recording, and Sui Generis Database
     Rights, without regard to how the rights are labeled or
     categorized. For purposes of this Public License, the rights
     specified in Section 2(b)(1)-(2) are not Copyright and Similar
     Rights.

  d. Effective Technological Measures means those measures that, in the
     absence of proper authority, may not be circumvented under laws
     fulfilling obligations under Article 11 of the WIPO Copyright
     Treaty adopted on December 20, 1996, and/or similar international
     agreements.

  e. Exceptions and Limitations means fair use, fair dealing, and/or
     any other exception or limitation to Copyright and Similar Rights
     that applies to Your use of the Licensed Material.

  f. Licensed Material means the artistic or literary work, database,
     or other material to which the Licensor applied this Public
     License.

  g. Licensed Rights means the rights granted to You subject to the
     terms and conditions of this Public License, which are limited to
     all Copyright and Similar Rights that apply to Your use of the
     Licensed Material and that the Licensor has authority to license.

  h. Licensor means the individual(s) or entity(ies) granting rights
     under this Public License.

  i. Share means to provide material to the public by any means or
     process that requires permission under the Licensed Rights, such
     as reproduction, public display, public performance, distribution,
     dissemination, communication, or importation, and to make material
     available to the public including in ways that members of the
     public may access the material from a place and at a time
     individually chosen by them.

  j. Sui Generis Database Rights means rights other than copyright
     resulting from Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of
     the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases,
     as amended and/or succeeded, as well as other essentially
     equivalent rights anywhere in the world.

  k. You means the individual or entity exercising the Licensed Rights
     under this Public License. Your has a corresponding meaning.


Section 2 -- Scope.

  a. License grant.

       1. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License,
          the Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free,
          non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to
          exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to:

            a. reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or
               in part; and

            b. produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material.

       2. Exceptions and Limitations. For the avoidance of doubt, where
          Exceptions and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public
          License does not apply, and You do not need to comply with
          its terms and conditions.

       3. Term. The term of this Public License is specified in Section
          6(a).

       4. Media and formats; technical modifications allowed. The
          Licensor authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in
          all media and formats whether now known or hereafter created,
          and to make technical modifications necessary to do so. The
          Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or
          authority to forbid You from making technical modifications
          necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including
          technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective
          Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License,
          simply making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)
          (4) never produces Adapted Material.

       5. Downstream recipients.

            a. Offer from the Licensor -- Licensed Material. Every
               recipient of the Licensed Material automatically
               receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the
               Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this
               Public License.

            b. No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose
               any additional or different terms or conditions on, or
               apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the
               Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the
               Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed
               Material.

       6. No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or
          may be construed as permission to assert or imply that You
          are, or that Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected
          with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status by,
          the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as
          provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).

  b. Other rights.

       1. Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not
          licensed under this Public License, nor are publicity,
          privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however, to
          the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to
          assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited
          extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed
          Rights, but not otherwise.

       2. Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this
          Public License.

       3. To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to
          collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed
          Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society
          under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory
          licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly
          reserves any right to collect such royalties.


Section 3 -- License Conditions.

Your exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the
following conditions.

  a. Attribution.

       1. If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified
          form), You must:

            a. retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor
               with the Licensed Material:

                 i. identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed
                    Material and any others designated to receive
                    attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by
                    the Licensor (including by pseudonym if
                    designated);

                ii. a copyright notice;

               iii. a notice that refers to this Public License;

                iv. a notice that refers to the disclaimer of
                    warranties;

                 v. a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the
                    extent reasonably practicable;

            b. indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and
               retain an indication of any previous modifications; and

            c. indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this
               Public License, and include the text of, or the URI or
               hyperlink to, this Public License.

       2. You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any
          reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in
          which You Share the Licensed Material. For example, it may be
          reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or
          hyperlink to a resource that includes the required
          information.

       3. If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the
          information required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent
          reasonably practicable.

       4. If You Share Adapted Material You produce, the Adapter's
          License You apply must not prevent recipients of the Adapted
          Material from complying with this Public License.


Section 4 -- Sui Generis Database Rights.

Where the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that
apply to Your use of the Licensed Material:

  a. for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right
     to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial
     portion of the contents of the database;

  b. if You include all or a substantial portion of the database
     contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database
     Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database
     Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material; and

  c. You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share
     all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database.

For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not
replace Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed

Section 5 -- Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.

  a. UNLESS OTHERWISE SEPARATELY UNDERTAKEN BY THE LICENSOR, TO THE
     EXTENT POSSIBLE, THE LICENSOR OFFERS THE LICENSED MATERIAL AS-IS
     AND AS-AVAILABLE, AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF
     ANY KIND CONCERNING THE LICENSED MATERIAL, WHETHER EXPRESS,
     IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHER. THIS INCLUDES, WITHOUT LIMITATION,
     WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
     PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS,
     ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT
     KNOWN OR DISCOVERABLE. WHERE DISCLAIMERS OF WARRANTIES ARE NOT
     ALLOWED IN FULL OR IN PART, THIS DISCLAIMER MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

  b. TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE, IN NO EVENT WILL THE LICENSOR BE LIABLE
     TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION,
     NEGLIGENCE) OR OTHERWISE FOR ANY DIRECT, SPECIAL, INDIRECT,
     INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, OR OTHER LOSSES,
     COSTS, EXPENSES, OR DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS PUBLIC LICENSE OR

     DAMAGES. WHERE A LIMITATION OF LIABILITY IS NOT ALLOWED IN FULL OR
     IN PART, THIS LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

  c. The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided
     above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent
     possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and
     waiver of all liability.


Section 6 -- Term and Termination.

  a. This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and
     Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with
     this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License
     terminate automatically.

  b. Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under
     Section 6(a), it reinstates:

       1. automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided
          it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the
          violation; or

       2. upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.

     For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any
     right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations
     of this Public License.

  c. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the
     Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop
     distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so

  a. The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different
     terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.

  b. Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the
     Licensed Material not stated herein are separate from and
     independent of the terms and conditions of this Public License.


Section 8 -- Interpretation.

  a. For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and
     shall not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose
     conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully
     be made without permission under this Public License.

  b. To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is
     deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the
     minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision
     cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License
     without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and
     conditions.

  c. No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no
     failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the
     Licensor.

  d. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted
     as a limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities
     that apply to the Licensor or You, including from the legal
     processes of any jurisdiction or authority.

change-case 5.4.4
MIT
# Change Case

> Transform a string between `camelCase`, `PascalCase`, `Capital Case`, `snake_case`, `kebab-case`, `CONSTANT_CASE` and others.

## Installation

```
npm install change-case --save
```

## Usage

```js
import * as changeCase from "change-case";

changeCase.camelCase("TEST_VALUE"); //=> "testValue"
```

Included case functions:

| Method            | Result      |
| ----------------- | ----------- |
| `camelCase`       | `twoWords`  |
| `capitalCase`     | `Two Words` |
| `constantCase`    | `TWO_WORDS` |
| `dotCase`         | `two.words` |
| `kebabCase`       | `two-words` |
| `noCase`          | `two words` |
| `pascalCase`      | `TwoWords`  |
| `pascalSnakeCase` | `Two_Words` |
| `pathCase`        | `two/words` |
| `sentenceCase`    | `Two words` |
| `snakeCase`       | `two_words` |
| `trainCase`       | `Two-Words` |

All methods accept an `options` object as the second argument:

- `delimiter?: string` The character to use between words. Default depends on method, e.g. `_` in snake case.
- `locale?: string[] | string | false` Lower/upper according to specified locale, defaults to host environment. Set to `false` to disable.
- `split?: (value: string) => string[]` A function to define how the input is split into words. Defaults to `split`.
- `prefixCharacters?: string` Retain at the beginning of the string. Defaults to `""`. Example: use `"_"` to keep the underscores in `__typename`.
- `suffixCharacters?: string` Retain at the end of the string. Defaults to `""`. Example: use `"_"` to keep the underscore in `type_`.

By default, `pascalCase` and `snakeCase` separate ambiguous characters with `_`. For example, `V1.2` would become `V1_2` instead of `V12`. If you prefer them merged you can set `mergeAmbiguousCharacters` to `true`.

### Split

**Change case** exports a `split` utility which can be used to build other case functions. It accepts a string and returns each "word" as an array. For example:

```js
split("fooBar")
  .map((x) => x.toLowerCase())
  .join("_"); //=> "foo_bar"
```

## Change Case Keys

```js
import * as changeKeys from "change-case/keys";

changeKeys.camelCase({ TEST_KEY: true }); //=> { testKey: true }
```

**Change case keys** wraps around the core methods to transform object keys to any case.

### API

- **input: any** Any JavaScript value.
- **depth: number** Specify the depth to transfer for case transformation. Defaults to `1`.
- **options: object** Same as base case library.

## TypeScript and ESM

This package is a [pure ESM package](https://gist.github.com/sindresorhus/a39789f98801d908bbc7ff3ecc99d99c) and ships with TypeScript definitions. It cannot be `require`'d or used with CommonJS module resolution in TypeScript.

      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
      source, and configuration files.

      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.

      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.

      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,

      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION

   1. Definitions.

      "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
      and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.

      "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
      the copyright owner that is granting the License.

      "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
      other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
      control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
      "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
      direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
      otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
      outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

      "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
      exercising permissions granted by this License.

      "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
      source, and configuration files.

      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.

      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a

      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

    "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object form,
    that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the editorial
    revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications represent,
    as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes of this
    License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain separable
    from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of, the Work and
    Derivative Works thereof.

    "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including the original

    hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge,
    royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to reproduce, prepare
    Derivative Works of, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense,
    and distribute the Work and such Derivative Works in
    Source or Object form.

3. Grant of Patent License.

    Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor
    hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge,
    royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this section) patent
    license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and
    otherwise transfer the Work, where such license applies only to those
    patent claims licensable by such Contributor that are necessarily
    infringed by their Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their
    Contribution(s) with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted.
    If You institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
    cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a
    Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct or
    contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to
    You under this License for that Work shall terminate as of the date such
    litigation is filed.

4. Redistribution.

    You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or Derivative Works
    thereof in any medium, with or without modifications, and in Source or
    Object form, provided that You meet the following conditions:

    1. You must give any other recipients of the Work or Derivative Works a
    copy of this License; and

    2. You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices stating
    that You changed the files; and

    3. You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works that You
    distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices from
    the Source form of the Work, excluding those notices that do not pertain
    to any part of the Derivative Works; and

    4. If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its distribution,
    then any Derivative Works that You distribute must include a readable copy
    of the attribution notices contained within such NOTICE file, excluding
    those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works,
    in at least one of the following places: within a NOTICE text file
    distributed as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
    documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or, within a
    display generated by the Derivative Works, if and wherever such
    third-party notices normally appear. The contents of the NOTICE file are
    for informational purposes only and do not modify the License.
    You may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative Works that You
    distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work,
    provided that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
    as modifying the License.

    You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may
    provide additional or different license terms and conditions for use,
    reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or for any such
    Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and
    distribution of the Work otherwise complies with the conditions
    stated in this License.

5. Submission of Contributions.

    Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution intentionally
    submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor shall be under
    the terms and conditions of this License, without any additional
    terms or conditions. Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall
    supersede or modify the terms of any separate license agreement you may
    have executed with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

6. Trademarks.

    This License does not grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks,
    service marks, or product names of the Licensor, except as required for
    reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Work and
    reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

7. Disclaimer of Warranty.

    Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, Licensor
    provides the Work (and each Contributor provides its Contributions)
    on an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND,
    either express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties
    or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS
    FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
    appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any risks
    associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

8. Limitation of Liability.

    In no event and under no legal theory, whether in tort
    (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required by
    applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or agreed
    to in writing, shall any Contributor be liable to You for damages,
    including any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential
    damages of any character arising as a result of this License or out of
    the use or inability to use the Work (including but not limited to damages
    for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction,
    or any and all other commercial damages or losses), even if such
    Contributor has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability.

    While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose
    to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty,
    indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with
    this License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
    on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any
    other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold
    each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims
    asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such
    warranty or additional liability.

      control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
      "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
      direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
      otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
      outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

      "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
      exercising permissions granted by this License.

      "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
      source, and configuration files.

      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.

      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

                        http://www.apache.org/licenses/

   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION

   1. Definitions.

      "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
      and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.

      "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
      the copyright owner that is granting the License.

      "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
      other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
      control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
      "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
      direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
      otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
      outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

      "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
      exercising permissions granted by this License.

      "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
      source, and configuration files.

      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.

      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.

      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following
      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "[]"
      replaced with your own identifying information. (Don't include
      the brackets!)  The text should be enclosed in the appropriate
      comment syntax for the file format. We also recommend that a
      file or class name and description of purpose be included on the
      same "printed page" as the copyright notice for easier
      identification within third-party archives.

# Is Module

Check whether a source string looks like an ES6 module.
This doesn't actually execute the code,
and doesn't check other module types.
So source strings without any module loaders returns `false`.

This is just what I need from https://github.com/yahoo/js-module-formats, which actually executes the sauce string in a subcontext.

## API

```js
var isES6Module = require('is-module');

console.log(isES6Module('import * from "emitter";')) // => true
```

is-reference 1.2.1
MIT
# is-reference

Utility for determining whether an AST node is a reference.

`foo` is a reference in these cases:

```js
console.log( foo );
var foo;
function foo () {}
function bar ( foo ) {}
export { foo as x };
```

`foo` is *not* a reference in these cases:

```js
var obj = { foo: 1 };
console.log( obj.foo );
export { x as foo };
```

In all cases, `foo` is an `Identifier` node, but the two kinds must be treated differently for the purposes of scope analysis etc. (The examples are non-exhaustive.)


## Installation

```bash
npm install is-reference
```


## Usage

Example using [Acorn](https://github.com/ternjs/acorn) and [estree-walker](https://github.com/Rich-Harris/estree-walker):

```js
const { parse } = require( 'acorn' );
const { walk } = require( 'estree-walker' );
const isReference = require( 'is-reference' );

const identifiers = [];
const references = [];

const ast = parse( `var a = b.c;` );

walk( ast, {
	enter ( node, parent ) {
		if ( node.type === 'Identifier' ) identifiers.push( node );
		if ( isReference( node, parent ) ) references.push( node );
	}
});

identifiers.forEach( node => console.log( node.name ) ); // a, b, c
references.forEach( node => console.log( node.name ) ); // a, b
```

mdn-data 2.0.28
CC0-1.0
CC0 1.0 Universal

Statement of Purpose

The laws of most jurisdictions throughout the world automatically confer
exclusive Copyright and Related Rights (defined below) upon the creator and
subsequent owner(s) (each and all, an "owner") of an original work of
authorship and/or a database (each, a "Work").

Certain owners wish to permanently relinquish those rights to a Work for the
purpose of contributing to a commons of creative, cultural and scientific
works ("Commons") that the public can reliably and without fear of later
claims of infringement build upon, modify, incorporate in other works, reuse
and redistribute as freely as possible in any form whatsoever and for any
purposes, including without limitation commercial purposes. These owners may
contribute to the Commons to promote the ideal of a free culture and the
further production of creative, cultural and scientific works, or to gain
reputation or greater distribution for their Work in part through the use and
efforts of others.

For these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any expectation
of additional consideration or compensation, the person associating CC0 with a
Work (the "Affirmer"), to the extent that he or she is an owner of Copyright
and Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily elects to apply CC0 to the Work
and publicly distribute the Work under its terms, with knowledge of his or her
Copyright and Related Rights in the Work and the meaning and intended legal
effect of CC0 on those rights.

1. Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available under CC0 may be
protected by copyright and related or neighboring rights ("Copyright and
Related Rights"). Copyright and Related Rights include, but are not limited
to, the following:

  i. the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display, communicate,
  and translate a Work;

  ii. moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s);

  iii. publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person's image or likeness
  depicted in a Work;

  iv. rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work,
  subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(a), below;

  v. rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of data in
  a Work;

  vi. database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC of the
  European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal
  protection of databases, and under any national implementation thereof,
  including any amended or successor version of such directive); and

  vii. other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the world
  based on applicable law or treaty, and any national implementations thereof.

2. Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention of,
applicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently, irrevocably and
unconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all of Affirmer's Copyright
and Related Rights and associated claims and causes of action, whether now
known or unknown (including existing as well as future claims and causes of
action), in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum
duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time
extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of
copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation
commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the "Waiver"). Affirmer makes
the Waiver for the benefit of each member of the public at large and to the
detriment of Affirmer's heirs and successors, fully intending that such Waiver
shall not be subject to revocation, rescission, cancellation, termination, or
any other legal or equitable action to disrupt the quiet enjoyment of the Work
by the public as contemplated by Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.

3. Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any reason be
judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, then the Waiver
shall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into account
Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to the extent the Waiver
is so judged Affirmer hereby grants to each affected person a royalty-free,
non transferable, non sublicensable, non exclusive, irrevocable and
unconditional license to exercise Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights in
the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration
provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time extensions), (iii)
in any current or future medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any
purpose whatsoever, including without limitation commercial, advertising or
promotional purposes (the "License"). The License shall be deemed effective as
of the date CC0 was applied by Affirmer to the Work. Should any part of the
License for any reason be judged legally invalid or ineffective under
applicable law, such partial invalidity or ineffectiveness shall not
invalidate the remainder of the License, and in such case Affirmer hereby
affirms that he or she will not (i) exercise any of his or her remaining
Copyright and Related Rights in the Work or (ii) assert any associated claims
and causes of action with respect to the Work, in either case contrary to
Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.

4. Limitations and Disclaimers.

  a. No trademark or patent rights held by Affirmer are waived, abandoned,
  surrendered, licensed or otherwise affected by this document.

  b. Affirmer offers the Work as-is and makes no representations or warranties
  of any kind concerning the Work, express, implied, statutory or otherwise,
  including without limitation warranties of title, merchantability, fitness
  for a particular purpose, non infringement, or the absence of latent or
  other defects, accuracy, or the present or absence of errors, whether or not
  discoverable, all to the greatest extent permissible under applicable law.

  c. Affirmer disclaims responsibility for clearing rights of other persons
  that may apply to the Work or any use thereof, including without limitation
  any person's Copyright and Related Rights in the Work. Further, Affirmer
  disclaims responsibility for obtaining any necessary consents, permissions
  or other rights required for any use of the Work.

  d. Affirmer understands and acknowledges that Creative Commons is not a
  party to this document and has no duty or obligation with respect to this
  CC0 or use of the Work.

napi-wasm 1.1.0
MIT
# napi-wasm

An implementation of the [napi](https://nodejs.org/api/n-api.html) API for WASM. Enables using some native Node modules in browsers and other environments.

## Setup

To use napi-wasm, there are a few requirements:

1. Configure your linker to export an indirect function table. With ldd, this is the `--export-table` flag. This enables JavaScript to call callback functions registered by WASM. It is exposed in the WebAssembly exports as `__indirect_function_table`.
2. Export a function from your WASM build named `napi_register_module_v1` (Node's default), or `napi_register_wasm_v1` for WASM-specific builds. This is called during initialization to setup the `exports` object for your module. It receives an environment and an exports object pointer as arguments, which you can add properties to.
3. Include a function named `napi_wasm_malloc` in your WASM build. This is called from JavaScript by napi-wasm to allocate memory in the WASM heap. It should accept a `uint32` size argument indicating the number of bytes to allocate, and return a `uint8` pointer to allocated memory.
4. Compile for the `wasm32-unknown-unknown` target.

### In Rust

The above steps should apply for any programming language, but here's an example in Rust. First, define a `napi_wasm_malloc` function so JavaScript can allocate memory in the WASM heap using the default allocator.

```rust
use std::alloc::{alloc, Layout};

#[no_mangle]
pub extern "C" fn napi_wasm_malloc(size: usize) -> *mut u8 {
  let align = std::mem::align_of::<usize>();
  if let Ok(layout) = Layout::from_size_align(size, align) {
    unsafe {
      if layout.size() > 0 {
        let ptr = alloc(layout);
        if !ptr.is_null() {
          return ptr;
        }
      } else {
        return align as *mut u8;
      }
    }
  }

  std::process::abort();
}
```

Next, implement `napi_register_wasm_v1` to register your module exports. We'll use the [napi-rs](https://github.com/napi-rs/napi-rs) bindings in this example to make it a bit nicer than calling C APIs directly. Note that the napi-rs `#[module_exports]` macro currently doesn't work in WASM because Rust doesn't support ctor setup functions in WASM targets yet, so we'll need to do this manually.

```rust
use napi::{Env, JsObject, NapiValue};

#[no_mangle]
pub unsafe extern "C" fn napi_register_wasm_v1(raw_env: napi::sys::napi_env, raw_exports: napi::sys::napi_value) {
  let env = Env::from_raw(raw_env);
  let exports = JsObject::from_raw_unchecked(raw_env, raw_exports);

  exports.create_named_method("transform", transform);
}

#[js_function(1)]
fn transform(ctx: CallContext) -> napi::Result<JsUnknown> {
  // ...
}
```

To compile, you need to export a function table and use the correct target.

```shell
 RUSTFLAGS="-C link-arg=--export-table" cargo build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown
```

This will output a file in `target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/debug/YOUR_CRATE.wasm` which you can load in a JavaScript environment.

You can also put the rust flags in a `.cargo/config.toml` file so you don't need to provide the environment variable each time you run `cargo build`.

```toml
[target.wasm32-unknown-unknown]
rustflags = ["-C", "link-arg=--export-table"]
```

### Loading

To load a WASM file and initialize a napi environment, you'll need to import the `napi-wasm` package. You instantiate a WASM module as usual, providing `napi` as the `env` import key. This provides the napi functions for your WASM module to use.

Then, pass the WASM instance to the `Environment` constructor to setup a napi environment. This will call `napi_register_wasm_v1` or `napi_register_module_v1` to setup the exports object. Then you can call functions on the exports object as you would in Node.

```js
import { Environment, napi } from 'napi-wasm';

// Construct a URL and instantiate a WebAssembly module as usual.
const url = new URL('path/to/lib.wasm', import.meta.url);
const { instance } = await WebAssembly.instantiateStreaming(fetch(url), {
  env: napi
});

// Create an environment.
let env = new Environment(instance);
let exports = env.exports;

// Use exports as usual!
exports.transform({
  // ...
});
```

When you are done with an `Environment`, call the `destroy()` function to clean up memory.

node-forge 1.3.1
(BSD-3-Clause OR GPL-2.0)
You may use the Forge project under the terms of either the BSD License or the
GNU General Public License (GPL) Version 2.

The BSD License is recommended for most projects. It is simple and easy to
understand and it places almost no restrictions on what you can do with the
Forge project.

If the GPL suits your project better you are also free to use Forge under
that license.

You don't have to do anything special to choose one license or the other and
you don't have to notify anyone which license you are using. You are free to
use this project in commercial projects as long as the copyright header is
left intact.

If you are a commercial entity and use this set of libraries in your
commercial software then reasonable payment to Digital Bazaar, if you can
afford it, is not required but is expected and would be appreciated. If this
library saves you time, then it's saving you money. The cost of developing
the Forge software was on the order of several hundred hours and tens of
thousands of dollars. We are attempting to strike a balance between helping
the development community while not being taken advantage of by lucrative
commercial entities for our efforts.

        GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
           Version 2, June 1991

 Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

          Preamble

  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This
General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to
your programs, too.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.

  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.

  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
rights.

  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
distribute and/or modify the software.

  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
authors' reputations.

  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

        GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains
a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below,
refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"
means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".

Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).
Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.

  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
along with the Program.

You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.

  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
    parties under the terms of this License.

    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.

Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
collective works based on the Program.

In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
the scope of this License.

  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:

    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,

    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
    customarily used for software interchange; or,

    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
    received the program in object code or executable form with such
    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)

The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source
code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a
special exception, the source code distributed need not include
anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
itself accompanies the executable.

If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
parties remain in full compliance.

  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
the Program or works based on it.

  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
this License.

  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.

If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
circumstances.

It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
impose that choice.

This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
be a consequence of the rest of this License.

  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
original copyright holder who places the Program under this License
may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
the limitation as if written in the body of this License.

  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions
either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of
this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
Foundation.

  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author
to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free
Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals
of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and
of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.

          NO WARRANTY

  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN
OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS
TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY
YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

                           Version 2.0, January 2004
                        http://www.apache.org/licenses/

   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION

   1. Definitions.

      "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
      and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.

      "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
      the copyright owner that is granting the License.

      "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
      other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
      control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
      "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
      direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
      otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
      outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

      "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
      exercising permissions granted by this License.

      "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
      source, and configuration files.

      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.

      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.

      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following
      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "[]"
      replaced with your own identifying information. (Don't include
      the brackets!)  The text should be enclosed in the appropriate
      comment syntax for the file format. We also recommend that a
      file or class name and description of purpose be included on the
      same "printed page" as the copyright notice for easier
      identification within third-party archives.

simple-git 3.27.0
MIT
# Simple Git

[![NPM version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/simple-git.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/simple-git)

A lightweight interface for running `git` commands in any [node.js](https://nodejs.org) application.

# Installation

Use your favourite package manager:

-  [npm](https://npmjs.org): `npm install simple-git`
-  [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/): `yarn add simple-git`

# System Dependencies

Requires [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) to be installed and that it can be called using the command `git`.

# Usage

Include into your JavaScript app using common js:

```javascript
// require the library, main export is a function
const simpleGit = require('simple-git');
simpleGit().clean(simpleGit.CleanOptions.FORCE);

// or use named properties
const { simpleGit, CleanOptions } = require('simple-git');
simpleGit().clean(CleanOptions.FORCE);
```

Include into your JavaScript app as an ES Module:

```javascript
import { simpleGit, CleanOptions } from 'simple-git';

simpleGit().clean(CleanOptions.FORCE);
```

Include in a TypeScript app using the bundled type definitions:

```typescript
import { simpleGit, SimpleGit, CleanOptions } from 'simple-git';

const git: SimpleGit = simpleGit().clean(CleanOptions.FORCE);
```

## Configuration

Configure each `simple-git` instance with a properties object passed to the main `simpleGit` function:

```typescript
import { simpleGit, SimpleGit, SimpleGitOptions } from 'simple-git';

const options: Partial<SimpleGitOptions> = {
   baseDir: process.cwd(),
   binary: 'git',
   maxConcurrentProcesses: 6,
   trimmed: false,
};

// when setting all options in a single object
const git: SimpleGit = simpleGit(options);

// or split out the baseDir, supported for backward compatibility
const git: SimpleGit = simpleGit('/some/path', { binary: 'git' });
```

The first argument can be either a string (representing the working directory for `git` commands to run in),
`SimpleGitOptions` object or `undefined`, the second parameter is an optional `SimpleGitOptions` object.

All configuration properties are optional, the default values are shown in the example above.

## Per-command Configuration

To prefix the commands run by `simple-git` with custom configuration not saved in the git config (ie: using the
`-c` command) supply a `config` option to the instance builder:

```typescript
// configure the instance with a custom configuration property
const git: SimpleGit = simpleGit('/some/path', { config: ['http.proxy=someproxy'] });

// any command executed will be prefixed with this config
// runs: git -c http.proxy=someproxy pull
await git.pull();
```

## Configuring Plugins

- [AbortController](https://github.com/steveukx/git-js/blob/main/docs/PLUGIN-ABORT-CONTROLLER.md)
   Terminate pending and future tasks in a `simple-git` instance (requires node >= 16).

- [Custom Binary](https://github.com/steveukx/git-js/blob/main/docs/PLUGIN-CUSTOM-BINARY.md)
   Customise the `git` binary `simple-git` uses when spawning `git` child processes. 

- [Completion Detection](https://github.com/steveukx/git-js/blob/main/docs/PLUGIN-COMPLETION-DETECTION.md)
   Customise how `simple-git` detects the end of a `git` process.

- [Error Detection](https://github.com/steveukx/git-js/blob/main/docs/PLUGIN-ERRORS.md)
   Customise the detection of errors from the underlying `git` process.

- [Progress Events](https://github.com/steveukx/git-js/blob/main/docs/PLUGIN-PROGRESS-EVENTS.md)
   Receive progress events as `git` works through long-running processes.

- [Spawned Process Ownership](https://github.com/steveukx/git-js/blob/main/docs/PLUGIN-SPAWN-OPTIONS.md)
   Configure the system `uid` / `gid` to use for spawned `git` processes.

- [Timeout](https://github.com/steveukx/git-js/blob/main/docs/PLUGIN-TIMEOUT.md)
   Automatically kill the wrapped `git` process after a rolling timeout.

- [Unsafe](https://github.com/steveukx/git-js/blob/main/docs/PLUGIN-UNSAFE-ACTIONS.md)
   Selectively opt out of `simple-git` safety precautions - for advanced users and use cases.

## Using Task Promises

Each task in the API returns the `simpleGit` instance for chaining together multiple tasks, and each
step in the chain is also a `Promise` that can be `await` ed in an `async` function or returned in a
`Promise` chain.

```javascript
const git = simpleGit();

// chain together tasks to await final result
await git.init().addRemote('origin', '...remote.git');

// or await each step individually
await git.init();
await git.addRemote('origin', '...remote.git');
```

### Catching errors in async code

To catch errors in async code, either wrap the whole chain in a try/catch:

```javascript
const git = simpleGit();
try {
   await git.init();
   await git.addRemote(name, repoUrl);
} catch (e) {
   /* handle all errors here */
}
```

or catch individual steps to permit the main chain to carry on executing rather than
jumping to the final `catch` on the first error:

```javascript
const git = simpleGit();
try {
   await git.init().catch(ignoreError);
   await git.addRemote(name, repoUrl);
} catch (e) {
   /* handle all errors here */
}

function ignoreError() {}
```

## Using Task Callbacks

In addition to returning a promise, each method can also be called with a trailing callback argument
to handle the result of the task.

```javascript
const git = simpleGit();
git.init(onInit).addRemote('origin', 'git@github.com:steveukx/git-js.git', onRemoteAdd);

function onInit(err, initResult) {}
function onRemoteAdd(err, addRemoteResult) {}
```

If any of the steps in the chain result in an error, all pending steps will be cancelled, see the
[parallel tasks](<(#concurrent--parallel-requests)>) section for more information on how to run tasks in parallel rather than in series .

## Task Responses

Whether using a trailing callback or a Promise, tasks either return the raw `string` or `Buffer` response from the
`git` binary, or where possible a parsed interpretation of the response.

For type details of the response for each of the tasks, please see the [TypeScript definitions](https://github.com/steveukx/git-js/blob/main/simple-git/typings/simple-git.d.ts).

# Upgrading from Version 2

From v3 of `simple-git` you can now import as an ES module, Common JS module or as TypeScript with bundled type
definitions. Upgrading from v2 will be seamless for any application not relying on APIs that were marked as deprecated
in v2 (deprecation notices were logged to `stdout` as `console.warn` in v2).

# API

Either returns a [BranchSummaryResult](https://github.com/steveukx/git-js/blob/main/simple-git/src/lib/responses/BranchSummary.ts) instance when listing branches, or a [BranchSingleDeleteResult](https://github.com/steveukx/git-js/blob/main/simple-git/typings/response.d.ts) type object when the options included `-d`, `-D` or `--delete` which cause it to delete a named branch rather than list existing branches.
-  `.branchLocal()` gets a list of local branches as a [BranchSummaryResult](https://github.com/steveukx/git-js/blob/main/simple-git/src/lib/responses/BranchSummary.ts) instance
-  `.deleteLocalBranch(branchName)` deletes a local branch - treats a failed attempt as an error
-  `.deleteLocalBranch(branchName, forceDelete)` deletes a local branch, optionally explicitly setting forceDelete to true - treats a failed attempt as an error
-  `.deleteLocalBranches(branchNames)` deletes multiple local branches
-  `.deleteLocalBranches(branchNames, forceDelete)` deletes multiple local branches, optionally explicitly setting forceDelete to true

## git clean

## git checkout

-  `.checkout(checkoutWhat , [options])` - checks out the supplied tag, revision or branch when supplied as a string,
   additional arguments supported by [git checkout](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-checkout) can be supplied as an
   [options](#how-to-specify-options) object/array.

-  `.checkout(options)` - check out a tag or revision using the supplied [options](#how-to-specify-options)

-  `.checkoutBranch(branchName, startPoint)` - checks out a new branch from the supplied start point.

-  `.checkoutLocalBranch(branchName)` - checks out a new local branch

## git clone

-  `.clone(repoPath, [localPath, [options]])` clone a remote repo at `repoPath` to a local directory at `localPath`, optionally with a standard [options](#how-to-specify-options) object of additional arguments to include between `git clone` and the trailing `repo local` arguments
-  `.clone(repoPath, [options])` clone a remote repo at `repoPath` to a directory in the current working directory with the same name as the repo

-  `mirror(repoPath, [localPath, [options]])` behaves the same as the `.clone` interface with the [`--mirror` flag](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-clone#Documentation/git-clone.txt---mirror) enabled.

## git config

-  `.addConfig(key, value, append = false, scope = 'local')` add a local configuration property, when `append` is set to
   `true` the configuration setting is appended to rather than overwritten in the local config. Use the `scope` argument
   to pick where to save the new configuration setting (use the exported `GitConfigScope` enum, or equivalent string
   values - `worktree | local | global | system`).
-  `.getConfig(key)` get the value(s) for a named key as a [ConfigGetResult](https://github.com/steveukx/git-js/blob/main/simple-git/typings/response.d.ts)
-  `.getConfig(key, scope)` get the value(s) for a named key as a [ConfigGetResult](https://github.com/steveukx/git-js/blob/main/simple-git/typings/response.d.ts) but limit the
   scope of the properties searched to a single specified scope (use the exported `GitConfigScope` enum, or equivalent
   string values - `worktree | local | global | system`)

-  `.listConfig()` reads the current configuration and returns a [ConfigListSummary](https://github.com/steveukx/git-js/blob/main/simple-git/src/lib/responses/ConfigList.ts)
-  `.listConfig(scope: GitConfigScope)` as with `listConfig` but returns only those items in a specified scope (note that configuration values are overlaid on top of each other to build the config `git` will actually use - to resolve the configuration you are using use `(await listConfig()).all` without the scope argument)

## git count-objects

- `.countObjects()` queries the pack and disk usage properties of the local repository and returns a [CountObjectsResult](https://github.com/steveukx/git-js/blob/main/simple-git/src/lib/tasks/count-objects.ts). All disk sizes are reported in Kb, see https://git-scm.com/docs/git-count-objects for full description of properties.

## git diff

-  `.diff([ options ])` get the diff of the current repo compared to the last commit, optionally including
   any number of other arguments supported by [git diff](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-diff) supplied as an
   [options](#how-to-specify-options) object/array. Returns the raw `diff` output as a string.

-  `.diffSummary([ options ])` creates a [DiffResult](https://github.com/steveukx/git-js/blob/main/simple-git/src/lib/responses/DiffSummary.ts)
   to summarise the diff for files in the repo. Uses the `--stat` format by default which can be overridden
   by passing in any of the log format commands (eg: `--numstat` or `--name-stat`) as part of the optional
   [options](#how-to-specify-options) object/array.

## git grep [examples](https://github.com/steveukx/git-js/blob/main/examples/git-grep.md)

-  `.grep(searchTerm)` searches for a single search term across all files in the working tree, optionally passing a standard [options](#how-to-specify-options) object of additional arguments
-  `.grep(grepQueryBuilder(...))` use the `grepQueryBuilder` to create a complex query to search for, optionally passing a standard [options](#how-to-specify-options) object of additional arguments

## git hash-object

-  `.hashObject(filePath, write = false)` computes the object ID value for the contents of the named file (which can be
   outside of the work tree), optionally writing the resulting value to the object database.

## git init

-  `.init(bare , [options])` initialize a repository using the boolean `bare` parameter to intialise a bare repository.
   Any number of other arguments supported by [git init](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-init) can be supplied as an
   [options](#how-to-specify-options) object/array.

-  `.init([options])` initialize a repository using any arguments supported by
   [git init](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-init) supplied as an [options](#how-to-specify-options) object/array.

## git log

-  `.log([options])` list commits between `options.from` and `options.to` tags or branch (if not specified will
   show all history). Use the `options` object to set any [options](#how-to-specify-options) supported by the
   [git log](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-log) command or any of the following:

   -  `options.file` - the path to a file in your repository to only consider this path.
   -  `options.format` - custom log format object, keys are the property names used on the returned object, values are the format string from [pretty formats](https://git-scm.com/docs/pretty-formats#Documentation/pretty-formats.txt)
   -  `options.from` - sets the oldest commit in the range to return, use along with `options.to` to set a bounded range
   -  `options.mailMap` - defaults to true, enables the use of [mail map](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitmailmap) in returned values for email and name from the default format
   -  `options.maxCount` - equivalent to setting the `--max-count` option
   -  `options.multiLine` - enables multiline body values in the default format (disabled by default)
   -  `options.splitter` - the character sequence to use as a delimiter between fields in the log, should be a value that doesn't appear in any log message (defaults to `ò`)
   -  `options.strictDate` - switches the authored date value from an ISO 8601-like format to be strict ISO 8601 format
   -  `options.symmetric` - defaults to true, enables [symmetric revision range](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitrevisions#_dotted_range_notations) rather than a two-dot range
   -  `options.to` - sets the newset commit in the range to return, use along with `options.from` to set a bounded range
   
   When only one of `options.from` and `options.to` is supplied, the default value of the omitted option is equivalent to `HEAD`. For any other commit, explicitly supply both from and to commits (for example use `await git.firstCommit()` as the default value of `from` to log since the first commit of the repo). 

## git merge

-  `.merge(options)` runs a merge using any configuration [options](#how-to-specify-options) supported
   by [git merge](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-merge).
   Conflicts during the merge result in an error response, the response is an instance of
   [MergeSummary](https://github.com/steveukx/git-js/blob/main/simple-git/src/lib/responses/MergeSummary.ts) whether it was an error or success.
   When successful, the MergeSummary has all detail from a the [PullSummary](https://github.com/steveukx/git-js/blob/main/simple-git/src/lib/responses/PullSummary.ts)
   along with summary detail for the merge.
   When the merge failed, the MergeSummary contains summary detail for why the merge failed and which files
   prevented the merge.

-  `.mergeFromTo(remote, branch , [options])` - merge from the specified branch into the currently checked out branch,
   similar to `.merge` but with the `remote` and `branch` supplied as strings separately to any additional

## git push

-  `.push([options])` pushes to a named remote/branch using any supported [options](#how-to-specify-options)
   from the [git push](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-push) command. Note that `simple-git` enforces the use of
   `--verbose --porcelain` options in order to parse the response. You don't need to supply these options.

-  `.push(remote, branch, [options])` pushes to a named remote/branch, supports additional
   [options](#how-to-specify-options) from the [git push](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-push) command.

-  `.pushTags(remote, [options])` pushes local tags to a named remote (equivalent to using `.push([remote, '--tags'])`)

## git remote

-  `.addRemote(name, repo, [options])` adds a new named remote to be tracked as `name` at the path `repo`, optionally with any supported [options](#how-to-specify-options) for the [git add](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-remote#Documentation/git-remote.txt-emaddem) call.
-  `.getRemotes([verbose])` gets a list of the named remotes, supply the optional `verbose` option as `true` to include the URLs and purpose of each ref
-  `.listRemote([options])` lists remote repositories - there are so many optional arguments in the underlying `git ls-remote` call, just supply any you want to use as the optional [options](#how-to-specify-options) eg: `git.listRemote(['--heads', '--tags'], console.log)`
-  `.remote([options])` runs a `git remote` command with any number of [options](#how-to-specify-options)
-  `.removeRemote(name)` removes the named remote

## git reset

-  `.reset(resetMode, [resetOptions])` resets the repository, sets the reset mode to one of the supported types (use a constant from
   the exported `ResetMode` enum, or a string equivalent: `mixed`, `soft`, `hard`, `merge`, `keep`). Any number of other arguments
   supported by [git reset](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-reset) can be supplied as an [options](#how-to-specify-options) object/array.

-  `.reset(resetOptions)` resets the repository with the supplied [options](#how-to-specify-options)

-  `.reset()` resets the repository in `soft` mode.

## git rev-parse / repo properties

-  `.revparse([options])` sends the supplied [options](#how-to-specify-options) to [git rev-parse](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-rev-parse) and returns the string response from `git`.

-  `.checkIsRepo()` gets whether the current working directory is a descendent of a git repository.
-  `.checkIsRepo('bare')` gets whether the current working directory is within a bare git repo (see either [git clone --bare](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-clone#Documentation/git-clone.txt---bare) or [git init --bare](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-init#Documentation/git-init.txt---bare)).

- `.showBuffer(options)` same as the `.show` API, but returns the Buffer content directly to allow for showing binary file content.

## git status

-  `.status([options])` gets the status of the current repo, resulting in a [StatusResult](https://github.com/steveukx/git-js/blob/main/simple-git/typings/response.d.ts). Additional arguments
   supported by [git status](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-status) can be supplied as an [options](#how-to-specify-options) object/array.

## git submodule

-  `.subModule(options)` Run a `git submodule` command with on or more arguments passed in as an [options](#how-to-specify-options) array or object

## git version [examples](https://github.com/steveukx/git-js/blob/main/examples/git-version.md)

- `.version()` retrieve the major, minor and patch for the currently installed `git`. Use the `.installed` property of the result to determine whether `git` is accessible on the path.

## changing the working directory [examples](https://github.com/steveukx/git-js/blob/main/examples/git-change-working-directory.md)

-  `.cwd(workingDirectory)` Sets the working directory for all future commands - note, this will change the working for the root instance, any chain created from the root will also be changed.
-  `.cwd({ path, root = false })` Sets the working directory for all future commands either in the current chain of commands (where `root` is omitted or set to `false`) or in the main instance (where `root` is `true`).

## How to Specify Options

Where the task accepts custom options (eg: `pull` or `commit`), these can be supplied as an object, the keys of which
will all be merged as trailing arguments in the command string, or as a simple array of strings.

### Options as an Object

When the value of the property in the options object is a `string`, that name value
pair will be included in the command string as `name=value`. For example:

```javascript
// results in 'git pull origin master --no-rebase'
git.pull('origin', 'master', { '--no-rebase': null });

// results in 'git pull origin master --rebase=true'
git.pull('origin', 'master', { '--rebase': 'true' });
```

### Options as an Array

Options can also be supplied as an array of strings to be merged into the task's commands
in the same way as when an object is used:

```javascript
// results in 'git pull origin master --no-rebase'
git.pull('origin', 'master', ['--no-rebase']);
```

# Release History

Major release 3.x changes the packaging of the library, making it consumable as a CommonJS module, ES module as well as
with TypeScript (see [usage](#usage) above). The library is now published as a single file, so please ensure your
application hasn't been making use of non-documented APIs by importing from a sub-directory path.

See also:

- [release notes v3](https://github.com/steveukx/git-js/blob/main/simple-git/CHANGELOG.md)
- [release notes v2](https://github.com/steveukx/git-js/blob/main/docs/RELEASE-NOTES-V2.md)

# Concurrent / Parallel Requests

When the methods of `simple-git` are chained together, they create an execution chain that will run in series, useful
for when the tasks themselves are order-dependent, eg:

```typescript
simpleGit().init().addRemote('origin', 'https://some-repo.git').fetch();
```

Each task requires that the one before it has been run successfully before it is called, any errors in a
step of the chain should prevent later steps from being attempted.

When the methods of `simple-git` are called on the root instance (ie: `git = simpleGit()`) rather than chained
off another task, it starts a new chain and will not be affected failures in tasks already being run. Useful
for when the tasks are independent of each other, eg:

```typescript
const git = simpleGit();
const results = await Promise.all([
   git.raw('rev-parse', '--show-cdup').catch(swallow),
   git.raw('rev-parse', '--show-prefix').catch(swallow),
]);
function swallow(err) {
   return null;
}
```

Each `simple-git` instance limits the number of spawned child processes that can be run simultaneously and
manages the queue of pending tasks for you. Configure this value by passing an options object to the
`simpleGit` function, eg:

```typescript
const git = simpleGit({ maxConcurrentProcesses: 10 });
```

Treating tasks called on the root instance as the start of separate chains is a change to the behaviour of
`simple-git` and was added in version `2.11.0`.

# Complex Requests

When no suitable wrapper exists in the interface for creating a request, run the command directly
using `git.raw([...], handler)`. The array of commands are passed directly to the `git` binary:

```javascript
const path = '/path/to/repo';
const commands = ['config', '--global', 'advice.pushNonFastForward', 'false'];

// using an array of commands and node-style callback
simpleGit(path).raw(commands, (err, result) => {
   // err is null unless this command failed
   // result is the raw output of this command
});

// using a var-args of strings and awaiting rather than using the callback
const result = await simpleGit(path).raw(...commands);

// automatically trim trailing white-space in responses
const result = await simpleGit(path, { trimmed: true }).raw(...commands);
```

# Authentication

The easiest way to supply a username / password to the remote host is to include it in the URL, for example:

```javascript
const USER = 'something';
const PASS = 'somewhere';
const REPO = 'github.com/username/private-repo';

const remote = `https://${USER}:${PASS}@${REPO}`;

simpleGit()
   .clone(remote)
   .then(() => console.log('finished'))
   .catch((err) => console.error('failed: ', err));
```

Be sure to not enable debug logging when using this mechanism for authentication
to ensure passwords aren't logged to stdout.

# Environment Variables

Pass one or more environment variables to the child processes spawned by `simple-git` with the `.env` method which
supports passing either an object of name=value pairs or setting a single variable at a time:

```javascript
const GIT_SSH_COMMAND = 'ssh -o UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no';

simpleGit()
   .env('GIT_SSH_COMMAND', GIT_SSH_COMMAND)
   .status((err, status) => {
      /*  */
   });

simpleGit()
   .env({ ...process.env, GIT_SSH_COMMAND })
   .status()
   .then((status) => {})
   .catch((err) => {});
```

Note - when passing environment variables into the child process, these will replace the standard `process.env`
variables, the example above creates a new object based on `process.env` but with the `GIT_SSH_COMMAND` property added.

# Exception Handling

When the `git` process exits with a non-zero status (or in some cases like `merge` the git process exits with a
successful zero code but there are conflicts in the merge) the task will reject with a `GitError` when there is no
available parser to handle the error or a
`GitResponseError` for when there is.

See the `err` property of the callback:

```javascript
git.merge((err, mergeSummary) => {
   if (err.git) {
      mergeSummary = err.git; // the failed mergeSummary
   }
});
```

Catch errors with try/catch in async code:

```javascript
try {
   const mergeSummary = await git.merge();
   console.log(`Merged ${mergeSummary.merges.length} files`);
} catch (err) {
   // err.message - the string summary of the error
   // err.stack - some stack trace detail
   // err.git - where a parser was able to run, this is the parsed content

   console.error(`Merge resulted in ${err.git.conflicts.length} conflicts`);
}
```

Catch errors with a `.catch` on the promise:

```javascript
const mergeSummary = await git.merge().catch((err) => {
   if (err.git) {
      return err.git;
   } // the unsuccessful mergeSummary
   throw err; // some other error, so throw
});

if (mergeSummary.failed) {
   console.error(`Merge resulted in ${mergeSummary.conflicts.length} conflicts`);
}
```

With typed errors available in TypeScript

```typescript
import { simpleGit, MergeSummary, GitResponseError } from 'simple-git';
try {
   const mergeSummary = await simpleGit().merge();
   console.log(`Merged ${mergeSummary.merges.length} files`);
} catch (err) {
   // err.message - the string summary of the error
   // err.stack - some stack trace detail
   // err.git - where a parser was able to run, this is the parsed content
   const mergeSummary: MergeSummary = (err as GitResponseError<MergeSummary>).git;
   const conflicts = mergeSummary?.conflicts || [];

   console.error(`Merge resulted in ${conflicts.length} conflicts`);
}
```

# Troubleshooting / FAQ

### Enable logging

See the [debug logging guide](https://github.com/steveukx/git-js/blob/main/docs/DEBUG-LOGGING-GUIDE.md) for logging examples and how to
make use of the [debug](https://www.npmjs.com/package/debug) library's programmatic interface
in your application.

### Enable Verbose Logging

See the [debug logging guide](https://github.com/steveukx/git-js/blob/main/docs/DEBUG-LOGGING-GUIDE.md#verbose-logging-options) for
the full list of verbose logging options to use with the
[debug](https://www.npmjs.com/package/debug) library.

### Every command returns ENOENT error message

There are a few potential reasons:

-  `git` isn't available as a binary for the user running the main `node` process, custom paths to the binary can be used
   with the `.customBinary(...)` API option.

-  the working directory passed in to the main `simple-git` function isn't accessible, check it is read/write accessible
   by the user running the `node` process. This library uses
   [@kwsites/file-exists](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@kwsites/file-exists) to validate the working directory exists,
   to output its logs add `@kwsites/file-exists` to your `DEBUG` environment variable. eg:

   `DEBUG=@kwsites/file-exists,simple-git node ./your-app.js`

### Log format fails

The properties of `git log` are fetched using the `--pretty=format` argument which supports different tokens depending
on the version of `git` - for example the `%D` token used to show the refs was added in git `2.2.3`, for any version
before that please ensure you are supplying your own format object with properties supported by the version of git you
are using.

For more details of the supported tokens, please see the
[official `git log` documentation](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-log#_pretty_formats)

### Log response properties are out of order

The properties of `git.log` are fetched using the character sequence `ò` as a delimiter. If your commit messages
use this sequence, supply a custom `splitter` in the options, for example: `git.log({ splitter: '💻' })`

### Pull / Diff / Merge summary responses don't recognise any files

-  Enable verbose logs with the environment variable `DEBUG=simple-git:task:*,simple-git:output:*`
-  Check the output (for example: `simple-git:output:diff:1 [stdOut] 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)`)
-  Check the `stdOut` output is the same as you would expect to see when running the command directly in terminal
-  Check the language used in the response is english locale

In some cases `git` will show progress messages or additional detail on error states in the output for
`stdErr` that will help debug your issue, these messages are also included in the verbose log.

### Legacy Node Versions

From `v3.x`, `simple-git` will drop support for `node.js` version 10 or below, to use in a lower version of node will
result in errors such as:

-  `Object.fromEntries is not a function`
-  `Object.entries is not a function`
-  `message.flatMap is not a function`

To resolve these issues, either upgrade to a newer version of node.js or ensure you are using the necessary polyfills
from `core-js` - see [Legacy Node Versions](https://github.com/steveukx/git-js/blob/main/docs/LEGACY_NODE_VERSIONS.md).

# Examples

### using a pathspec to limit the scope of the task

If the `simple-git` API doesn't explicitly limit the scope of the task being run (ie: `git.add()` requires the files to
be added, but `git.status()` will run against the entire repo), add a `pathspec` to the command using trailing options:

```typescript
import { simpleGit, pathspec } from "simple-git";

const git = simpleGit();
const wholeRepoStatus = await git.status();
const subDirStatusUsingOptArray = await git.status([pathspec('sub-dir')]);
const subDirStatusUsingOptObject = await git.status({ 'sub-dir': pathspec('sub-dir') });
```

### async await

```javascript
async function status(workingDir) {
   let statusSummary = null;
   try {
      statusSummary = await simpleGit(workingDir).status();
   } catch (e) {
      // handle the error
   }

   return statusSummary;
}

// using the async function
status(__dirname + '/some-repo').then((status) => console.log(status));
```

### Initialise a git repo if necessary

```javascript
const git = simpleGit(__dirname);

git.checkIsRepo()
   .then((isRepo) => !isRepo && initialiseRepo(git))
   .then(() => git.fetch());

function initialiseRepo(git) {
   return git.init().then(() => git.addRemote('origin', 'https://some.git.repo'));
}
```

### Update repo and get a list of tags

```javascript
simpleGit(__dirname + '/some-repo')
   .pull()
   .tags((err, tags) => console.log('Latest available tag: %s', tags.latest));

// update repo and when there are changes, restart the app
simpleGit().pull((err, update) => {
   if (update && update.summary.changes) {
      require('child_process').exec('npm restart');
   }
});
```

### Starting a new repo

```javascript
simpleGit()
   .init()
   .add('./*')
   .commit('first commit!')
   .addRemote('origin', 'https://github.com/user/repo.git')
   .push('origin', 'master');
```

### push with `-u`

```javascript
simpleGit()
   .add('./*')
   .commit('first commit!')
   .addRemote('origin', 'some-repo-url')
   .push(['-u', 'origin', 'master'], () => console.log('done'));
```

### Piping to the console for long-running tasks

See [progress events](https://github.com/steveukx/git-js/blob/main/docs/PLUGIN-PROGRESS-EVENTS.md) for more details on
logging progress updates.

```javascript
const git = simpleGit({
   progress({ method, stage, progress }) {
      console.log(`git.${method} ${stage} stage ${progress}% complete`);
   },
});
git.checkout('https://github.com/user/repo.git');
```

### Update repo and print messages when there are changes, restart the app

```javascript
// when using a chain
simpleGit()
   .exec(() => console.log('Starting pull...'))
   .pull((err, update) => {
      if (update && update.summary.changes) {
         require('child_process').exec('npm restart');
      }
   })
   .exec(() => console.log('pull done.'));

// when using async and optional chaining
const git = simpleGit();
console.log('Starting pull...');
if ((await git.pull())?.summary.changes) {
   require('child_process').exec('npm restart');
}
console.log('pull done.');
```

### Get a full commits list, and then only between 0.11.0 and 0.12.0 tags

```javascript
console.log(await simpleGit().log());
console.log(await simpleGit().log('0.11.0', '0.12.0'));
```

### Set the local configuration for author, then author for an individual commit

```javascript
simpleGit()
   .addConfig('user.name', 'Some One')
   .addConfig('user.email', 'some@one.com')
   .commit('committed as "Some One"', 'file-one')
   .commit('committed as "Another Person"', 'file-two', {
      '--author': '"Another Person <another@person.com>"',
   });
```

### Get remote repositories

```javascript
simpleGit().listRemote(['--get-url'], (err, data) => {
   if (!err) {
      console.log('Remote url for repository at ' + __dirname + ':');

# sirv ![CI](https://github.com/lukeed/sirv/workflows/CI/badge.svg)

> The optimized and lightweight middleware for serving requests to static assets

You may use `sirv` as a *very* fast and lightweight alternative to [`serve-static`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/serve-static).

The massive performance advantage over `serve-static` is explained by **not** relying on the file system for existence checks on every request. These are expensive interactions and must be avoided whenever possible! Instead, when not in "dev" mode, `sirv` performs all its file-system operations upfront and then relies on its cache for future operations.

This middleware will work out of the box for [Polka](https://github.com/lukeed/polka), Express, and other Express-like frameworks. It will also work with the native `http`, `https` and `http2` modules. It requires _very_ little effort to modify/wrap it for servers that don't accept the `(req, res, next)` signature.

:bulb: For a feature-complete CLI application, check out the sibling [`sirv-cli`](https://github.com/lukeed/sirv/tree/master/packages/sirv-cli) package as an alternative to [`zeit/serve`](https://github.com/zeit/serve)~!

## Install

```
$ npm install --save sirv
```


## Usage

```js
const sirv = require('sirv');
const polka = require('polka');
const compress = require('compression')();

// Init `sirv` handler
const assets = sirv('public', {
  maxAge: 31536000, // 1Y
  immutable: true
});

polka()
  .use(compress, assets)
  .use('/api', require('./api'))
  .listen(3000, err => {
    if (err) throw err;
    console.log('> Ready on localhost:3000~!');
  });
```


## API

### sirv(dir, opts={})

Returns: `Function`

The returned function is a middleware in the standard Express-like signature: `(req, res, next)`, where `req` is the [`http.IncomingMessage`](https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#http_class_http_incomingmessage), `res` is the [`http.ServerResponse`](https://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v9.x/docs/api/http.html#http_class_http_serverresponse), and `next` (in this case) is the function to call if no file was found for the given path.

When defined, a `next()` callback is always called _instead of_ the [`opts.onNoMatch`](#optsonnomatch) callback. However, unlike `onNoMatch`, your `next()` is given no arguments.

#### dir
Type: `String`<br>
Default: `.`

The directory from which to read and serve assets. It is resolved to an absolute path &mdash; you must provide an absolute path yourself if `process.cwd()` is not the correct assumption.

#### opts.dev
Type: `Boolean`<br>
Default: `false`

Enable "dev" mode, which disables/skips caching. Instead, `sirv` will traverse the file system ***on every request***.

Additionally, `dev` mode will ignore `maxAge` and `immutable` as these options generate a production-oriented `Cache-Control` header value.

> **Important:** Do not use `dev` mode in production!

#### opts.etag
Type: `Boolean`<br>
Default: `false`

Generate and attach an `ETag` header to responses.

> **Note:** If an incoming request's [`If-None-Match` header](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/If-None-Match) matches the `ETag` value, a `304` response is given.

#### opts.dotfiles
Type: `Boolean`<br>
Default: `false`

Allow requests to dotfiles (files or directories beginning with a `.`).

> **Note:** Requests to [`/.well-known/*`](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8615) are always allowed.

#### opts.extensions
Type: `Array<String>`<br>
Default: `['html', 'htm']`

The file extension fallbacks to check for if a pathame is not initially found. For example, if a `/login` request cannot find a `login` filename, it will then look for `login.html` and `login.htm` before giving up~!

> **Important:** Actually, `sirv` will **also** look for `login/index.html` and `login/index.htm` before giving up.

#### opts.gzip
Type: `Boolean`<br>
Default: `false`

Determine if `sirv` look for **precompiled** `*.gz` files.<br>
Must be enabled _and_ the incoming request's [`Accept Encoding`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Accept-Encoding) must include "gzip" in order for `sirv` to search for the gzip'd alternative.

> **Note:** The `.gz` assumption also applies to the `opts.extensions` list.

```js
// NOTE: PSEUDO CODE
// Showing lookup logic

// Request: [Accept-Encoding: gzip] "/foobar.jpg"
lookup([
  '/foobar.jpg.gz', '/foobar.jpg',
  '/foobar.jpg.html.gz', '/foobar.jpg/index.html.gz',
  '/foobar.jpg.htm.gz', '/foobar.jpg/index.htm.gz',
  '/foobar.jpg.html', '/foobar.jpg/index.html',
  '/foobar.jpg.htm', '/foobar.jpg/index.htm',
]);

// Request: [Accept-Encoding: gzip] "/"
lookup([
  '/index.html.gz',
  '/index.htm.gz',
  '/index.html',
  '/index.htm',
]);
```


#### opts.brotli
Type: `Boolean`<br>
Default: `false`

Determine if `sirv` look for **precompiled** `*.br` files.<br>
Must be enabled _and_ the incoming request's [`Accept Encoding`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Accept-Encoding) must include either "br" or "brotli" in order for `sirv` to search for the brotli-compressed alternative.

> **Note:** The `.br` assumption also applies to the `opts.extensions` list.

When both `opts.broli` and `opts.gzip` are enabled &mdash; and all conditions are equal &mdash; then the brotli variant always takes priority.

```js
// NOTE: PSEUDO CODE
// Showing lookup logic

// Request: [Accept-Encoding: br] "/foobar.jpg"
lookup([
  '/foobar.jpg.br', '/foobar.jpg',
  '/foobar.jpg.html.br', '/foobar.jpg/index.html.br',
  '/foobar.jpg.htm.br', '/foobar.jpg/index.htm.br',
  '/foobar.jpg.html', '/foobar.jpg/index.html',
  '/foobar.jpg.htm', '/foobar.jpg/index.htm',
]);

// Request: [Accept-Encoding: br,gz] "/"
lookup([
  '/index.html.br'
  '/index.htm.br'
  '/index.html.gz'
  '/index.htm.gz'
  '/index.html'
  '/index.htm'
]);
```

#### opts.maxAge
Type: `Number`<br>
Default: `undefined`

Enables the `Cache-Control` header on responses and sets the `max-age` value (in seconds).<br>
For example, `maxAge: 31536000` is equivalent to one year.

#### opts.immutable
Type: `Boolean`<br>
Default: `false`

Appends the [`immutable` directive](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Cache-Control#Revalidation_and_reloading) on your `Cache-Control` header, used for uniquely-named assets that will not change!

> **Important:** Will only work if `opts.maxAge` has a value defined!

#### opts.single
Type: `Boolean` or `String`<br>
Default: `false`

Treat the directory as a single-page application.

When `true`, the directory's index page (default `index.html`) will be sent if the request asset does not exist.<br>
You may pass a `string` value to use a file _instead of_ `index.html` as your fallback.

For example, if "/about" is requested but no variants of that file exist, then the response for "/" is sent instead:

```js
// Note: This is psuedo code to illustrate what's happening

// Request: "/about"
let file = find(['/about', '/about.html', '/about.htm', '/about/index.html', '/about.htm']);
if (file) {
  send(file);
} else if (opts.single === true) {
  file = find(['/', '/index.html', '/index.htm']);
  send(file);
} else if (typeof opts.single === 'string') {
  file = find([opts.single]);
  send(file);
} else {
  // next() or 404
}
```

#### opts.ignores
Type: `false` or `Array<String | RegExp>`

Specify paths/patterns that should ignore the fallback behavior that `opts.single` provides.

By default, any asset-like path (URLs that end with an extension) will be ignored. This means that, for example, if `/foobar.jpg` is not found, a `404` response is sent instead of the `index.html` fallback.

Additionally, any `/.well-known/*` pathname ignores the fallback – as do all other dotfile requests when `opts.dotfiles` is enabled.

Any string value(s) will be passed through `new RegExp(value, 'i')` directly.

Finally, you may set `ignores: false` to disable ***all*** ignores, including the defaults. Put differently, this will fallback ***all*** unknown pathnames to your `index.html` (or custom `opts.single` value).

> **Important:** Only has an effect if `opts.single` is enabled.

#### opts.onNoMatch
Type: `Function`

A custom function to run if a file cannot be found for a given request. <br>By default, `sirv` will send a basic `(404) Not found` response.

The function receives the current `req <IncomingMessage>, res <ServerResponse>` pair for as its two arguments.

> **Note:** This won't run if a `next` callback has been provided to the middleware; see [`sirv`](#sirvdir-opts) description.

#### opts.setHeaders
Type: `Function`

A custom function to append or change any headers on the outgoing response. There is no default.

Its signature is `(res, pathname, stats)`, where `res` is the `ServerResponse`, `pathname` is incoming request path (stripped of queries), and `stats` is the file's result from [`fs.statSync`](https://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#fs_fs_statsync_path).

      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or

          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided

      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,

stackback 0.0.2
MIT
# stackback

Returns an array of CallSite objects for a captured stacktrace. Useful if you want to access the frame for an error object.

## use

```javascript
var stackback = require('stackback');

// error generated from somewhere
var err = new Error('some sample error');

// stack is an array of CallSite objects
var stack = stackback(err);
```

## CallSite object

From the [V8 StackTrace API](https://code.google.com/p/v8/wiki/JavaScriptStackTraceApi)

The structured stack trace is an Array of CallSite objects, each of which represents a stack frame. A CallSite object defines the following methods

getThis: returns the value of this  
getTypeName: returns the type of this as a string. This is the name of the function stored in the constructor field of this, if available, otherwise the object's [[Class]] internal property.  
getFunction: returns the current function  
getFunctionName: returns the name of the current function, typically its name property. If a name property is not available an attempt will be made to try to infer a name from the function's context.  
getMethodName: returns the name of the property of this or one of its prototypes that holds the current function  
getFileName: if this function was defined in a script returns the name of the script  
getLineNumber: if this function was defined in a script returns the current line number  
getColumnNumber: if this function was defined in a script returns the current column number  
getEvalOrigin: if this function was created using a call to eval returns a CallSite object representing the location where eval was called  
isToplevel: is this a toplevel invocation, that is, is this the global object?  
isEval: does this call take place in code defined by a call to eval?  
isNative: is this call in native V8 code?  
isConstructor: is this a constructor call?  

## install

```shell
npm install stackback
```

                           Version 2.0, January 2004
                        http://www.apache.org/licenses/

   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION

   1. Definitions.

      "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
      and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.

      "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
      the copyright owner that is granting the License.

      "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
      other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
      control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
      "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
      direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
      otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
      outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

      "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
      exercising permissions granted by this License.

      "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
      source, and configuration files.

      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.

      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.

      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following
      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "[]"
      replaced with your own identifying information. (Don't include
      the brackets!)  The text should be enclosed in the appropriate
      comment syntax for the file format. We also recommend that a
      file or class name and description of purpose be included on the
      same "printed page" as the copyright notice for easier
      identification within third-party archives.

type-fest 4.37.0
(MIT OR CC0-1.0)
Creative Commons Legal Code

CC0 1.0 Universal

    CREATIVE COMMONS CORPORATION IS NOT A LAW FIRM AND DOES NOT PROVIDE
    LEGAL SERVICES. DISTRIBUTION OF THIS DOCUMENT DOES NOT CREATE AN
    ATTORNEY-CLIENT RELATIONSHIP. CREATIVE COMMONS PROVIDES THIS
    INFORMATION ON AN "AS-IS" BASIS. CREATIVE COMMONS MAKES NO WARRANTIES
    REGARDING THE USE OF THIS DOCUMENT OR THE INFORMATION OR WORKS
    PROVIDED HEREUNDER, AND DISCLAIMS LIABILITY FOR DAMAGES RESULTING FROM
    THE USE OF THIS DOCUMENT OR THE INFORMATION OR WORKS PROVIDED
    HEREUNDER.

Statement of Purpose

The laws of most jurisdictions throughout the world automatically confer
exclusive Copyright and Related Rights (defined below) upon the creator
and subsequent owner(s) (each and all, an "owner") of an original work of
authorship and/or a database (each, a "Work").

Certain owners wish to permanently relinquish those rights to a Work for
the purpose of contributing to a commons of creative, cultural and
scientific works ("Commons") that the public can reliably and without fear
of later claims of infringement build upon, modify, incorporate in other
works, reuse and redistribute as freely as possible in any form whatsoever
and for any purposes, including without limitation commercial purposes.
These owners may contribute to the Commons to promote the ideal of a free
culture and the further production of creative, cultural and scientific
works, or to gain reputation or greater distribution for their Work in
part through the use and efforts of others.

For these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any
expectation of additional consideration or compensation, the person
associating CC0 with a Work (the "Affirmer"), to the extent that he or she
is an owner of Copyright and Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily
elects to apply CC0 to the Work and publicly distribute the Work under its
terms, with knowledge of his or her Copyright and Related Rights in the
Work and the meaning and intended legal effect of CC0 on those rights.

1. Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available under CC0 may be
protected by copyright and related or neighboring rights ("Copyright and
Related Rights"). Copyright and Related Rights include, but are not
limited to, the following:

  i. the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display,
     communicate, and translate a Work;
 ii. moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s);
iii. publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person's image or
     likeness depicted in a Work;
 iv. rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work,
     subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(a), below;
  v. rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of data
     in a Work;
 vi. database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC of the
     European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal
     protection of databases, and under any national implementation
     thereof, including any amended or successor version of such
     directive); and
vii. other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the
     world based on applicable law or treaty, and any national
     implementations thereof.

2. Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention
of, applicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently,
irrevocably and unconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all of
Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights and associated claims and causes
of action, whether now known or unknown (including existing as well as
future claims and causes of action), in the Work (i) in all territories
worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration provided by applicable law or
treaty (including future time extensions), (iii) in any current or future
medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever,
including without limitation commercial, advertising or promotional
purposes (the "Waiver"). Affirmer makes the Waiver for the benefit of each
member of the public at large and to the detriment of Affirmer's heirs and
successors, fully intending that such Waiver shall not be subject to
revocation, rescission, cancellation, termination, or any other legal or
equitable action to disrupt the quiet enjoyment of the Work by the public
as contemplated by Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.

3. Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any reason
be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, then the
Waiver shall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into
account Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to the
extent the Waiver is so judged Affirmer hereby grants to each affected
person a royalty-free, non transferable, non sublicensable, non exclusive,
irrevocable and unconditional license to exercise Affirmer's Copyright and
Related Rights in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the
maximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future
time extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number
of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without
limitation commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the
"License"). The License shall be deemed effective as of the date CC0 was
applied by Affirmer to the Work. Should any part of the License for any
reason be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, such
partial invalidity or ineffectiveness shall not invalidate the remainder
of the License, and in such case Affirmer hereby affirms that he or she
will not (i) exercise any of his or her remaining Copyright and Related
Rights in the Work or (ii) assert any associated claims and causes of
action with respect to the Work, in either case contrary to Affirmer's
express Statement of Purpose.

4. Limitations and Disclaimers.

 a. No trademark or patent rights held by Affirmer are waived, abandoned,
    surrendered, licensed or otherwise affected by this document.
 b. Affirmer offers the Work as-is and makes no representations or
    warranties of any kind concerning the Work, express, implied,
    statutory or otherwise, including without limitation warranties of
    title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non
    infringement, or the absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or
    the present or absence of errors, whether or not discoverable, all to
    the greatest extent permissible under applicable law.
 c. Affirmer disclaims responsibility for clearing rights of other persons
    that may apply to the Work or any use thereof, including without
    limitation any person's Copyright and Related Rights in the Work.
    Further, Affirmer disclaims responsibility for obtaining any necessary
    consents, permissions or other rights required for any use of the
    Work.
 d. Affirmer understands and acknowledges that Creative Commons is not a
    party to this document and has no duty or obligation with respect to
    this CC0 or use of the Work.

                        http://www.apache.org/licenses/

   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION

   1. Definitions.

      "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
      and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.

      "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
      the copyright owner that is granting the License.

      "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
      other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
      control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
      "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
      direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
      otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
      outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

      "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
      exercising permissions granted by this License.

      "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
      source, and configuration files.

      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.

      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.

      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following
      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "[]"
      replaced with your own identifying information. (Don't include
      the brackets!)  The text should be enclosed in the appropriate
      comment syntax for the file format. We also recommend that a
      file or class name and description of purpose be included on the
      same "printed page" as the copyright notice for easier
      identification within third-party archives.

> 
>    5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,

> 
>    9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing

>       and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
>       or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
>       License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
>       on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
>       of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,

>       incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
>       of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
